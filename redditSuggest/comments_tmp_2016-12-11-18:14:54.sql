We like to move around a lot though, so we usually stay pretty warm.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I picked up a hydroflask to keep my coffee warm last year, and all my fishing buddies soon had one as well.  They make tons of different sizes, and make some that work for food also.

Weigh all your food. For you eat under 1500 calories a day. And no soda. You can eat anything you want as long as you stay under 1500 calories a day. If you want to lose weight faster then drop to 1200 calories a day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is all about calories. If you ate 113g of butter that would be 810 calories. If you ate that in a day you would lose weight (don&amp;#39;t do it though) I recommend eating chicken breast. In 100grams of chicken breast there is 165 calories and 31 grams of protein. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you count your calories and you don&amp;#39;t lose weight then you are counting calories wrong.

AutoModerator	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It looks like you are talking about the book &lt;em&gt;Guns, Germs, and Steel&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Jared Diamond&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The book over the past years has become rather popular, which is hardly surprising since it is a good and entertaining read. It has reached the point that for some people it has sort of reached the status of gospel. On &lt;a href="/r/history"&gt;/r/history&lt;/a&gt; we noticed a trend where every time a question was asked that has even the slightest relation to the book a dozen or so people would jump in and recommending the book.  Which in the context of history is a bit problematic and the reason this reply has been written. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why it is problematic can be broken down into two reasons: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In academic history there isn&amp;#39;t such thing as one definitive authority or work on things, there are often others who research the same subjects and people that dive into work of others to build on it or to see if it indeed holds up. This being critical of your sources and not relying on one source is actually a very important history skill often lacking when dozens of people just spam the same work over and over again as a definite guide and answer to &amp;quot;everything&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There are a good amount modern historians and anthropologists that are quite critical of &lt;em&gt;Guns, Germs, and Steel&lt;/em&gt; and there are some very real issues with Diamond&amp;#39;s work. These issues are often overlooked or not noticed by the people reading his book. Which is understandable given the fact that for many it will be their first exposure to the subject. Considering the popularity of the book it is also te reason that we felt it was needed to create this response. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, every time the book was posted in &lt;a href="/r/history"&gt;/r/history&lt;/a&gt;, it would be accompanied by critical notes and other works covering the same subject. Lacking that a dozen other people would quickly respond and do the same. But simply put, that isn&amp;#39;t always going to happen and as a result, we have created this response so people can be made aware of these things. Does this mean that the &lt;a href="/r/history"&gt;/r/history&lt;/a&gt; mods hate the book or Diamond himself? No, if that was the case we would simply instruct the bot to remove every mention of it, this is just an attempt to bring some balance to a conversation that in popular history had become a bit unbalanced.\nIt should also be noted that being critical of someone&amp;#39;s work isn&amp;#39;t that same as outright dismissing it. Historians are always critical of any work they examine, that is part of they core skill set and key in doing good research. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Below you&amp;#39;ll find a list of other works covering much of the same subject, further below you&amp;#39;ll find an explanation of why many historians and anthropologists are critical of Diamonds work. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Other works covering the same and similar subjects.&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174710.Seven_Myths_of_the_Spanish_Conquest"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39020.1491"&gt;&lt;em&gt;1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Last-Days-Incas-Kim-MacQuarrie/dp/0743260503/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last Days of the Inca&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/354038.The_Last_Days_of_the_Incas"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epidemics and Enslavement: Biological Catastrophe in the Native Southeast, 1492-1715&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/199002.The_Great_Divergence"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Great Divergence&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9491855-why-the-west-rules-for-now"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why the West Rules for Now&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/983034.Ecological_Imperialism"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ecological Imperialism: The Biological Expansion of Europe, 900-1900&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39020.1491"&gt;&lt;em&gt;1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Criticism on &lt;em&gt;Guns, Germs, and Steel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many historians and anthropologists believe Diamond plays fast and loose with history by generalizing highly complex topics to provide an ecological/geographical determinist view of human history that. There is a reason historians avoid grand theories of human history: those &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-so_story"&gt;&amp;quot;just so stories&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; don&amp;#39;t adequately explain human history. It&amp;#39;s true however that it is an entertaining introductory text that forces people to look at world history from a different vantage point. That being said, Diamond writes a rather oversimplified narrative that seemingly ignores the human element of history.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cherry-picked data while ignoring the complexity of issues&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In his chapter &amp;quot;Lethal Gift of Livestock&amp;quot; on the origin of human crowd infections he picks 5 pathogens that best support his idea of domestic origins. However, when diving into the genetic and historic data, only two pathogens (maybe influenza and most likely measles) could possibly have jumped to humans through domestication. The majority were already a part of the human disease load before the origin of agriculture, domestication, and sedentary population centers. \nThis is an example of Diamond ignoring the evidence that didn&amp;#39;t support his theory to explain conquest via disease spread to immunologically naive Native Americas. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A similar case of cherry-picking history is seen when discussing the conquest of the Inca.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pizarro&amp;#39;s military advantages lay in the Spaniards&amp;#39; steel swords and other weapons, steel armor, guns, and horses... Such imbalances of equipment were decisive in innumerable other confrontations of Europeans with Native Americans and other peoples. The sole Native Americans able to resist European conquest for many centuries were those tribes that reduced the military disparity by acquiring and mastering both guns and horses.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a very broad generalization that effectively makes it false. Conquest was not a simple matter of conquering a people, raising a Spanish flag, and calling &amp;quot;game over.&amp;quot; Conquest was a constant process of negotiation, accommodation, and rebellion played out through the ebbs and flows of power over the course of centuries. Some Yucatan Maya city-states maintained independence for two hundred years after contact, were &amp;quot;conquered&amp;quot;, and then immediately rebelled again. \nThe Pueblos along the Rio Grande revolted in 1680, dislodged the Spanish for a decade, and instigated unrest that threatened the survival of the entire northern edge of the empire for decades to come. \nTechnological &amp;quot;advantage&amp;quot;, in this case guns and steel, did not automatically equate to battlefield success in the face of resistance, rough terrain and vastly superior numbers. The story was far more nuanced, and conquest was never a cut and dry issue, which in the book is not really touched upon. In the book it seems to be case of the Inka being conquered when Pizarro says they were conquered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncritical examining of the historical record surrounding conquest&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being critical of the sources you come across and be aware of their context, biases and agendas is a core skill of any historian. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pizarro, Cortez and other conquistadores were biased authors who wrote for the sole purpose of supporting/justifying their claim on the territory, riches and peoples they subdued. To do so they elaborated their own sufferings, bravery, and outstanding deeds, while minimizing the work of native allies, pure dumb luck, and good timing. If you only read their accounts you walk away thinking a handful of adventurers conquered an empire thanks to guns and steel and a smattering of germs. No historian in the last half century would be so naive to argue this generalized view of conquest, but European technological supremacy is one keystone to Diamond&amp;#39;s thesis so he presents conquest at the hands of a handful of adventurers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The construction of the arguments for GG&amp;amp;S paints Native Americans specifically, and the colonized world in general, as categorically inferior&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To believe the narrative you need to view Native Americans as fundamentally naive, unable to understand Spanish motivations and desires, unable react to new weapons/military tactics, unwilling to accommodate to a changing political landscape, incapable of mounting resistance once conquered, too stupid to invent the key technological advances used against them, and doomed to die because they failed to build cities, domesticate animals and thereby acquire infectious organisms. When viewed through this lens, we hope you can see why so many historians and anthropologists are livid that a popular writer is perpetuating a false interpretation of history while minimizing the agency of entire continents full of people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Further reading.&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in reading more about what others think of Diamon&amp;#39;s book you can give these resources a go: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/historians_views#wiki_historians.27_views_of_jared_diamond.27s_.22guns.2C_germs.2C_and_steel.22"&gt;/r/askHistorians section in their FAQ about GG&amp;amp;S&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://louisproyect.wordpress.com/2009/04/24/jim-blaut-on-jared-diamond/"&gt;Jim Blaut on Jared Diamond&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

BurnySandals	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For cleaning use Mineral Spirits. If the letters have a thick coating of ink use a small brass brush with mineral spirits. (odorless mineral spirits are available at every hardware store. It is the safer modern equivalent to Varisol.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I am correct and the Smith Corona has a sealed bottom. You want to take the bottom plate off to clean it. Using a dropper or Q-tips put little amounts on all the moving parts and then move them letting excess mineral spirits drip out the bottom. Repeat until the part is clean and moves freely. Wipe gunk off from all the none moving parts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Traditionally only certain parts of the typewriter are lubricated with 10w machine oil. (Sewing machine oil.) Everyone including me use too much the first time. But even if you use the proper amount dust still sticks to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Liquid-Wrench-L512-Lubricant-CERFLON/dp/B000CPJLE4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481447526&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=teflon+spray+cerflon"&gt;Liquid Wrench&lt;/a&gt; Teflon spray to lubricate all the moving parts. (It is cheaper to get it from an auto parts store or Wal-Mart.) It works as well as 10w oil and because it is dry dust doesn&amp;#39;t stick to it. Spray everywhere, quickly wipe it off anywhere you don&amp;#39;t want a coating of white dust.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I recommend the Liquid Wrench because it worked best of all the ones I tried. Do not use the Dupont Teflon spray because its &amp;quot;Patented Bonding,&amp;quot; agent means it is much harder to clean from anywhere you don&amp;#39;t want it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db1wxyr	2016-12-11 09:34:07	Best way to clean and oil keys of a Smith-Corona Classic 12	t1_db1wxyr	TypewriterRepair	t5_3ag1c	t3_5hnjj5

MikeRollerson	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was just going to put up a post on this since I&amp;#39;ve been a big fan of the external lights with the Lomo&amp;#39;Wide!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Lomo uses a PC-Sync rather than Hotshoe (which almost all flashes nowadays use). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are 2 ways to do it: \nConnect the flash directly using a PC-Sync cable (which limits your reach) or use a radio trigger that has a PC-Sync input to wirelessly trigger your flash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a picture of my setup and some pictures taken with it tonight:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://imgur.com/a/5yNN1"&gt;http://imgur.com/a/5yNN1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The transmitter is an old Yongnuo RF-602 (about $10; the new ones don&amp;#39;t have a PC-sync input) and the flashes are Yongnyou YN560 III&amp;#39;s (about $60/each).  I attached a coldshoe directly onto the camera so that the transmitter can attach to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that point, it&amp;#39;s essentially just a matter of taking a photo!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind the Lomo is not automatic. You need to measure the flash for 1/30 second, ISO 800 and F8 aperture. If you have a DSLR, this is very easy as you can set those settings, take a photo (with the flash) and light it accordingly, then use those same flash settings with the lomo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What you want to look for is a Manual flash. No use in paying for an ETTL (automatic) flash since the Lomo won&amp;#39;t make use of it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This flash is $35 on amazon and has a PC Sync input (you&amp;#39;ll need a PC Sync cable): &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GR079XI/"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GR079XI/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you connect the cable directly from the camera to the flash, you can dial-in the power on the flash manually (full power, half power, 1/4 power, etc.. all the way down to 1/128 power).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NOTE: I have not used that flash; that was the cheapest one I saw that had a PC Sync input&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feel free to let me know if you had any specific questions!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db1x5st	2016-12-11 09:46:35	Lomo'Instant Wide external flash help	t1_db1x5st	Polaroid	t5_2ser7	t3_5hpc8c
amigomigo	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;#39;t say I&amp;#39;m 100% alt-right, but I consider myself a reformed hippie (23F) slowly making an escape from the radical liberal vacuum I was raised and educated in. Went to a small liberal arts school that is somewhat of a mecca for hippie dippie stoners, which I somewhat shamefully identified up until this year. So happy to be out from under my ROCK. Amazing how the &amp;#39;caged bird feeling free without experiencing life outside the cage&amp;#39; can be applied to both sides of the political/social issues spectrum. Ceasing to victimize myself in those spheres has helped my depression a lot, too. I was blaming myself for shit I should never have to worry about. Silly. You can still be a good person with strong morals, and act with compassion, even if you don&amp;#39;t agree with BLM or Hillary Clinton.

pandaonbeach	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your forehead is red and feels tight, it is probably dry and irritated. You can multi-mask, with a hydrating and soothing mask on your forehead and a brightening mask on the rest of your face. To prevent winter dryness, I like to layer serums and moisturizers. I depend on Hyaluronic Acid to keep my skin hydrated, along with a gel moisturizer, and a moisturizer lotion on top of that. You can also just put the moisturizer lotion just on your dry areas of your forehead if it is too heavy for the rest of your face.&lt;br/&gt;\nHydrating layers: 1. &lt;a href="http://ordinaries.com/product/rdn-hyaluronic-acid-2pct-b5-30ml"&gt;Hyaluronic Acid serum&lt;/a&gt;, 2. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TONYMOLY-Appletox-Honey-Cream-80ml/dp/B007WZR1OO?th=1"&gt;gel moisturizer&lt;/a&gt;, 3. &lt;a href="http://www.fresh.com/US/best-sellers/lotus-youth-preserve-face-cream/H00002669.html?gclid=CjwKEAiAj7TCBRCp2Z22ue-zrj4SJACG7SBE5kOchoovEkDhKwzXHUszOcGNTqYDrP0iZ6Rf0TfhvxoCJfDw_wcB"&gt;lotion/cream&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;\nLinked for #1 and #2 are stuff that I use and recommend, for #3 is the moisturizer you have already.

mrrovin	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I published my first book, &lt;em&gt;All Besides I&lt;/em&gt;, back in September this year. I was surprised and happy to come across this subreddit, and I thought I&amp;#39;d share my book with anyone potentially interested in reading it. It started as a little fantasy story I&amp;#39;d been working on and off for over a few years. It&amp;#39;s a self-contained story written like a memoir, and while the timeline of the plot spans decades, the tone isn&amp;#39;t very epic. It&amp;#39;s supposed to feel more personal. I&amp;#39;ve never expected sales or recognition from the beginning, I was just happy to know I could write a book. It&amp;#39;s the first entry in what I&amp;#39;d like as a collection of other books written by the same narrator - though with different/unrelated self-contained stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SYNOPSIS:&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;All Besides I&lt;/em&gt; is the first book of a planned series known as The Tomes &amp;amp; The Reflections: a series of independent stories set in a distant world, in distant times. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Besides I&lt;/em&gt; starts off the saga with the story of a strange being: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Morrow came by the Roheekan frontier. An alien design plunged into foreign soil. From under the Sun emerged: One who is not where he is supposed to be. This is a tale set across a foreign land, on a foreign world. Enter Takay: home to many peoples - all under the Wake of the Sun and Two Moons. &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I lived under the Wake, and what god then prays to the Sun?&amp;quot; This is a chronicle of sorts.&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Follow this stranger as he recollects, through his memoir, the trials and tribulations of one who is struggling to find meaning in a world as familiar to us as history. See the events of a mythic era take shape, and know His story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have paperback copies direct from my self-publishing platform, &lt;a href="https://www.createspace.com/6491329"&gt;Createspace&lt;/a&gt;. You can also buy a paperback copy on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Besides-Tomes-Reflections-Scott-Carroll/dp/1537024213/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481454247&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=all+besides+I"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; as well as an ebook format &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-Besides-Tomes-Reflections-Book-ebook/dp/B01LWUQ4ZY/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481454247&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;keywords=all+besides+I"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db1yic7	2016-12-11 11:05:11	Weekly Self Promotion Thread - December 11, 2016	t1_db1yic7	selfpublish	t5_2sew3	t3_5hlof6

AskWhatNext	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, good for you for wanting to get started early and for doing some research and reaching out here. All steps that show you&amp;#39;re thinking about this rather than just jumping in blind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started investing when I was 18. I thought I could get rich or make good money picking individual stocks but it&amp;#39;s not that easy. As I got older I stopped picking stocks and haven&amp;#39;t purchased an individual company stock in over 16 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I only buy index mutual funds through Vanguard (no trading fees and very low fund fees) and have done so much better than trying to pick stocks. You might hear a term &amp;quot;lazy portfolio&amp;quot; it&amp;#39;s when you invest in a diversified but small number of index funds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d recommend &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coffeehouse-Investor-Wealth-Ignore-Street/dp/159184584X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481457432&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=coffee+house+investor"&gt;The Coffeehouse Investor by Bill Schultheis&lt;/a&gt; He&amp;#39;s a big proponent of the lazy type of portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db1zfj8	2016-12-11 11:59:52	I'm 19 and looking for advice on how to start/where to begin with investing in the stock market.	t1_db1zfj8	personalfinance	t5_2qstm	t3_5hpgpo

24811812513198111524	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some videos:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WQzxxWBM-A"&gt;Haile running&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSIDRHUWlVo"&gt;natural running tutorial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can analyze their forms here, look how efficient and smooth they are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/z4NV4_5Wkic?t=10m40s"&gt;Frank shorter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_Nygi01VqI"&gt;Abebe Bikila&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see how frank seems to be leaning forward and his legs move almost like a wheel, rhythmically? He isn&amp;#39;t running across the ground, he&amp;#39;s falling and catching himself with each step. Running is continuous falling. He isn&amp;#39;t leaning forward or craning his back either, with proper form your body ends up in that lean and your legs end up at a certain natural cadence. If you aren&amp;#39;t fighting your body then running faster comes easily. Actual running can be enjoyable and easy, not painful. Much of the pain comes from improper/inefficient running technique. It&amp;#39;s the difference between going with the grain and against it. Efficient running is going with the grain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember when I first took off these awful shoes that I had that were really hurting me back in the day (they weren&amp;#39;t even the correct size and they were puma sneakers) and I ran barefoot and went way faster. My heart would beat and my breath would have trouble keeping up with how fast I was going but my legs had no problem with it. I also noticed my cadence increased and I went much faster. This was in like tenth grade, before I did cross country my junior year. I was just getting into running.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you run with proper form, you don&amp;#39;t need to try to move your legs faster, they end up moving faster on their own. You get around a 180 cadence (maybe slightly less or more). It doesn&amp;#39;t have to be exact but it ends up being around that. Many people go slower, like 130 steps per minute, it&amp;#39;s because they&amp;#39;re running inefficiently. Look at all elite runners and they have a similar cadence and stride. Interestingly enough the world record holder for the 5000m and 10000m had a cadence of around 190 and it was around 215 for his final kick at the olympics. His stride remained the same.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you run correctly it feels effortless, like you&amp;#39;re gliding across the ground, flying almost. That first time you really get it right it feels amazing, when i&amp;#39;ve taken off shoes I felt like a weight had lifted off me (it had) and it was like my feet weren&amp;#39;t there. When you don&amp;#39;t have issues picking up your feet then you go faster and when you don&amp;#39;t have an arch preventing your feet from naturally carrying you forward than you go faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you look at most runners who are fast and even sprinters like Usain Bolt who dominate, you&amp;#39;ll notice that their legs come up behind to their butts. This happens more with faster races than longer races like marathons, but it&amp;#39;s a pattern. This is because these runners have good hip mobility and hip extension. Having a posterior pelvic tilt or weak glutes and a weak back can lead to an inability to have that same range of motion. The legs coming up behind you to your butt is a sign of efficient form and it means your legs are moving like slingshots and you aren&amp;#39;t wasting energy to go as fast as you&amp;#39;re going, you&amp;#39;re being efficient. You&amp;#39;ll notice in Kenenisa Bekele&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/QSSBtxvd5BI?t=8m25s"&gt;world record 5000m run&lt;/a&gt; his legs come up right behind his butt. His hip extension and hip mobility is on point. If your hip flexors are weak and your hip extensors are short and you have weak glutes or pelvic tilt issues then you will not be able to do that. Of course running properly can strengthen all those muscles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would recommend running in dirt or grass and seeing what it feels like, you can even wear socks. I&amp;#39;ve gone running in socks before. When you run properly it will feel like it hurts more than usual. It&amp;#39;s like if you sit with good posture and it hurts more than slouching. Slouching is still worse for you. You will eventually get used to it, but don&amp;#39;t run inefficiently because it hurts less &lt;em&gt;at first&lt;/em&gt;. It will be better for you in the long &lt;em&gt;run&lt;/em&gt;. (get it? long &lt;em&gt;run?&lt;/em&gt; ayyy)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t stretch after biking you will have to stretch after running or injury is a risk. DO NOT stretch before, only stretch afterwards. There are dynamic stretches or warm ups you can do before running but just starting to run is a warm up itself. No static stretching, one exception which you may need to make is stretching your quads by bending at your knee and bringing your foot behind you to your butt. &lt;a href="http://helpyourback.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Standing-quadriceps-stretch.jpg?x72215"&gt;Like this&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;#39;s the one stretch that&amp;#39;s okay to do before running.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have used an exercise bike in the past when I was just starting to exercise. I don&amp;#39;t like riding regular bikes because I&amp;#39;m not that good at it and I have trouble crossing streets. I don&amp;#39;t like the thin road bikes because they require slouching and a bit of pelvis tucking and that bothers me, it may be different for you. I just think running is better overall for your body while biking works less muscles, but they both are cardio and cardio is good for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HHYEZBC/ref=twister_B00CSHV75A"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is the exact model of shoes that worked really well for me during track season in xc. I set most of my PRs in this shoe and I had the best luck with them. I got injured later because I purchased a shoe with a terrible arch that rolled my ankles outward, but these shoes are great. They are neutral running shoes, they may have more on the bottom than your average minimalist shoe or sock, but they are neutral and good for practicing good form, although you may have trouble landing on your toes at first if you use these types of shoes. Of course going exactly on your toes isn&amp;#39;t ideal, it may be good to get the transition going and prevent you from heel striking if you currently do, but you should be landing on your forefoot. That means slightly in front of the middle area of your foot, definitely not the heel though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just remember looking for neutral shoes with little heel rise or arch is the best way to go. Flat, neutral shoes, no rise. Not shoes for under or overpronation, neutral works great, it&amp;#39;s closer to being barefoot than shoes with huge arches or angles. When it comes to form these shoes may be better, depending on how much you run the one I linked may get worn out quickly, but surface and how hard you pound the pavement as well as how often matters. If the shoes gets torn apart you obviously don&amp;#39;t want to keep using it, rather get a new one. I think I used mine 3 or more months, but I couldn&amp;#39;t afford newer ones, I would have replaced them earlier. Let&amp;#39;s say if you&amp;#39;re running 60 miles a weeks than 2-3 months should be good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are going to get minimalist shoes instead of those ones then avoid the five finger shoes! They spread your toes apart and that will hurt your running and make you run weakly and may even cause injury. Having your toes apart in socks or barefoot is fine because they are apart anyway, but having them apart in those shoes will prevent you from &amp;quot;kicking&amp;quot; off the ground or having any power in your run, when I used those five finger gimmicks I ended up doing a weird walk/waddle run because I couldn&amp;#39;t push off my toes, and trying would probably hurt them. They were forced apart. If going for minimalist shoes, go for ones that keep your toes together, like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Merrell-Trail-Glove-Barefoot-Running/dp/B005N4IUL4"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; or the ones in the suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;FYI my normal shoe size and my spike size was 10 but my running shoe size was 9.5. A good shoe will still screw you over if it doesn&amp;#39;t fit you properly, so be sure to get a proper fit.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db1zi8m	2016-12-11 12:04:23	Brain Gain: Aerobic Exercise Pumps Up Gray Matter	t1_db1zi8m	Nootropics	t5_2r81c	t1_db1ykff

It&amp;#39;s a low-fat (not fat-free) cookbook, though, so that may not strike your/your SO&amp;#39;s mom&amp;#39;s fancy. Still, I&amp;#39;ve made lots of tasty things from it, and I&amp;#39;m not a dieter.

But really they&amp;#39;ll play with anything. The point is to give him options so that he&amp;#39;s busy. \n3. A tall cat tree is a great idea, ours loves his, but really our main problem is that to get our attention (seriously it&amp;#39;s why he does it), he likes to get behind the tv and fuck w/the wires, or get between my desktop monitors and the wall and do the same. We&amp;#39;ve tried putting obstacles there, but he finds a way.\nSo really, just know that they generally always need/want your attention. It would help if there&amp;#39;s another pet tbh, we&amp;#39;ve even entertained getting a puppy cause I think a dog or another bengal, so I think if the dog is cool w/cats, that will be the catalyst to a peaceful home w/a bengal.

CocoLeFleur	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am considering building my own PC, but I am a novice. I just saw this system on Amazon: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HNBLHAA/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HNBLHAA/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Will that be sufficient to play games such as CS:GO, Black Ops 3, and other FPS games at 1080p on high settings? I am coming from Xbox One to PC, so even if I have to play on medium settings to maintain 60fps (60hz refresh rate on monitor) it will still be a significant improvement and I will be happy. The system linked is at the very limit of my budget. I would need a copy of Windows 10, a keyboard and mouse if I were to build a system myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For $720, is that system beatable if I build it myself and use the same or comparable parts?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db21j5z	2016-12-11 13:46:35	Simple Questions - December 11, 2016	t1_db21j5z	buildapc	t5_2rnve	t3_5hpsgv

oh_my_baby	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was a 32 G pre-pregnancy and gargantuan by the end.  I used a boppy nursing pillow and loved it, but I am sure other brands are great, too, just something!  It does feel like you have about 12 less hands than you need in the beginning, but you will figure it out. Babies make a lot of noise while they breastfeed.  You will be able to hear her breathing and swallowing so it would be obvious if she could not breathe.  I don&amp;#39;t recall ever have any smothering problems.  Really early on, since she was so tiny I had to tuck her body under the boob that she was not feeding on so that she could get close enough to eat.  We breastfed for 16 months.  The first month was hard.  We had latching issues and I had bloody nipples, but we eventually got there.  I don&amp;#39;t think the latching had anything to do with my breast size.  I would also recommend lanolin cream and these &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lansinoh-Soothies-Breastfeeding-Mothers-Count/dp/B002KGHUL4?th=1"&gt;soothie gels&lt;/a&gt;.

ellusiveidea	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it depends on what you want to do.  If all you are going to do is 5 gallon extract then what you are looking at is likely fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you decide to go to BIAB and want to do a full volume mash, then 8 gallons is going to be tight.  You could always go the route of a separate mash tun in which case the 8 gallon boil kettle would be fine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was about to buy the same combo you are looking at when the Bayou Classic SS 44 qt was offered for sale on Amazon for $52.  At that price it was a no brainer.  It is currently offered on Amazon at $82 - not sure how often it goes on sale.  &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bayou-Classic-1044-44-Quart-Stainless-Steel/dp/B000VXHKMC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481464938&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=bayou+classic+44+qt"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Bayou-Classic-1044-44-Quart-Stainless-Steel/dp/B000VXHKMC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481464938&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=bayou+classic+44+qt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a burner I picked up the bayou classic sq14.  Seems like plenty of homebrewers use it with no problem.  So far I have only fired it up to burn off the paint on the stand.  I heated around 8 gallons of cold water to almost boiling (small bubbles)  in around 20 minutes.  I didn&amp;#39;t take it to a boil as I was only interested in burning off the paint and didn&amp;#39;t want to waste propane.  I am confident this burner will work just fine.  It runs around $40 on Amazon.  &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bayou-Classic-Single-Burner-Patio/dp/B0009JXYQ4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481465286&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=bayou+classic+sq14"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Bayou-Classic-Single-Burner-Patio/dp/B0009JXYQ4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481465286&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=bayou+classic+sq14&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db22532	2016-12-11 14:11:05	8 gallon Tall Boy kettle and Dark Star gas burner combo for $96.

TheOnlyCaveat	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, not knowing your budget, I&amp;#39;ll just throw out a few suggestions of things under $100 dollars that I, as a running-obsessed girl, would want.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.oiselle.com/shop/gifts-for-runners/rundies"&gt;Oiselle&amp;#39;s Rundies $70&lt;/a&gt; - Totally cute, fun, underwear for runners. Oiselle is a company that focuses solely on women&amp;#39;s products. Their products are high-quality and functional.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Allied-Medal-Hanger-Believed-Could/dp/B00QFS2USQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481465135&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=she+believed+she+could+so+she+did+medal+hanger"&gt;&amp;quot;She believed she could so she did&amp;quot; medal hanger $50-$80&lt;/a&gt; - Price depends on size. If your girlfriend does races and has race medals, one of these is a great way to keep them organized and displayed. There are many different designs with different quotes and whatnot, so take your pick, this is just my favorite.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.buffwear.com/"&gt;Buff headwear $20-30&lt;/a&gt; - I don&amp;#39;t actually have one of these yet, but it&amp;#39;s on my wishlist for this year. A multi-functional piece of fabric good for hot or cold weather. Choose from dozens of different colors and designs. Check out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSvRm4CHmvE"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; to see all the different ways it can be worn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://feeturesrunning.com/"&gt;Feetures! Compression socks $15-$50&lt;/a&gt; - Talk about a gift that a runner really wants - compression socks are the shit. Especially if she&amp;#39;s running in some sorry ass cotton socks right now, she might ask you to marry her if you buy her some Feetures. &lt;a href="https://feeturesrunning.com/height/no-show-tab"&gt;These are the ones I run in&lt;/a&gt;, but if somebody got me a pair of &lt;a href="https://feeturesrunning.com/height/knee-high"&gt;these knee-highs&lt;/a&gt; I&amp;#39;d probably die from happiness. Feetures come with a lifetime guarantee and come in some pretty cool colors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I could probably go on and on and on about running stuff, but this is a pretty good list to get you started. Hope I&amp;#39;ve helped.

Traspen	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I first started making bread I had most of the rudimentary things that I needed.

bearadox	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would invest $50-100 in a good pair of binoculars before you invest even more in a telescope. Telescopes are much more stable and customizable (namely in terms of changing the eyepieces/magnification), and you&amp;#39;ll be able to pick out details like the rings of Saturn which you won&amp;#39;t get from binoculars. However, they require a larger investment, more setup time, and are not nearly as portable (a big deal if you want to do some stargazing on a hiking trip). They&amp;#39;re also just more complicated to use, at least at first.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few years back I purchased some &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Celestron-SkyMaster-Binoculars-Tripod-Adapter/dp/B00008Y0VN/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481466179&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=celestron+skymaster#customerReviews"&gt;Skymaster 15x70&lt;/a&gt; binos. They are quite powerful and work well on a tripod. However, there have been systemic issues with the lenses falling out of alignment over time. This can be fixed by adjusting a few screws (you can Google it), so if you don&amp;#39;t mind a bit of mechanical work I can recommend them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db22pao	2016-12-11 14:31:56	Can you help me ?	t1_db22pao	Astronomy	t5_2qhor	t3_5hdzrk

randall13	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think there&amp;#39;s another name for the Clever dripper, per se.

Good comparison of the versions &lt;a href="https://static.prima-coffee.com/media/products/abid/clever-v2/clever-design-changes-product-listing.jpg"&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not the best to answer on material - so hopefully someone else chimes in, but... I&amp;#39;d point primarily to the affect on heat. Ceramic is going to hold heat a little better than plastic or metal... but I wouldn&amp;#39;t let that affect your decision if you&amp;#39;re looking to buy a single cup. &lt;a href="/u/SirGeekaLot"&gt;u/SirGeekaLot&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#39;s run down of filters and taste would be where I would focus while trying to choose one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db22wvc	2016-12-11 14:39:26	Pour overs	t1_db22wvc	Coffee	t5_2qhze	t1_db219fr

Amenisis	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;All these are responses are spot on. The only one I wanted to touch on was the charging for nighttime sleep monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I use mine for fitness and work with seeing the time without pulling out my phone, seeing emails, calls and txt before deciding if I need to pull out the phone. It has saved me so much time not checking it every 5-15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that though about half the days I use the battery to 10/20% by the end of the day, so I charge mine before I go to bed and top it off when I wake and get ready.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From almost dead, mine charges in under an hour, usually closer to 45 minutes and in the am when i top it off from sleeping it takes just 5-10 max.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So just get int eh hobbit of topping it off morning and night and you should be able to wear it almost 24/7 with few if any power issues.

verge36	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, not really sure about what a complete beginner might think about the book, i already knew some basic concepts of java-classes, methods syntax Generic methods etc.- thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Java-Complete-Reference-Herbert-Schildt/dp/0071808558"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. I also took a mandatory C course at University. I read until java.util, then decided to use Sedgewick&amp;#39;s book, because i thought i needed some exercises so Sedgewick&amp;#39;s course felt just right. It had plenty of exercises, and the right amount of explanations for most cases. However recursive functions are sometimes complex, and the lack of explanation sometimes makes them hard to understand. Otherwise gret book for beginners. I feel much more comfortable writing code now. \nWill look into the algorithms course, that was the part of the book i enjoyed most tbh.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db243li	2016-12-11 15:17:47	[Java]What should i do next?	t1_db243li	learnprogramming	t5_2r7yd	t1_db23ltr

The steps listed above are perfect.    My best advice is, if the fish store can hold the fish for you until you set up your tank at home, do that.    Other than that you&amp;#39;re just at a race against time from the moment the fish go into the bags.   You benefit from being close to your LFS, so don&amp;#39;t worry! And post pics when its done!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db244iv	2016-12-11 15:18:33	Moving 155 gallon tank	t1_db244iv	aquarium	t5_2rf28	t1_db1zdjq

Michiganders	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to save more, maybe look into the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Acer-Aspire-i3-7100U-Windows-E5-575-33BM/dp/B01K1IO3QW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?s=pc&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481137735&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=acer+i3&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=laptologist05-20&amp;amp;linkId=1e420f668795a360ad987fe367bdecc0"&gt;Acer E15&lt;/a&gt; for $340. It has new Kaby Lake i3 processor, 4gb of ram and a 1TB HDD. The ram and storage are also upgradable. It&amp;#39;s graphics are intel HD 620 which aren&amp;#39;t the best but are still powerful enough for just about any steam / browser game / minecraft. It also has a full 1080p display and a very long battery life. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want more RAM and an SSD, with slightly less gaming potential, look into the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-15-ay013nr-Full-HD-Generation-Windows/dp/B01CGGOZOW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;amp;ascsub&amp;amp;s=pc&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1480124303&amp;amp;sr=1-3&amp;amp;keywords=15-ay013nr&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=laptologist05-20&amp;amp;linkId=21fd405174094871b757c82678607ff9"&gt;HP 15&lt;/a&gt; for $430. It has a skylake i5 processor, 8gb of ram and a 128GB SSD (upgradable if you wish). It also has a decent battery life, a lightweight for a 15.6&amp;#39;&amp;#39; at 4.65 pounds, and a 1080p display. It&amp;#39;s graphics are intel HD 520 which are about 15% less powerful than the HD 620 graphics of the Acer, but likely still fine for most of his needs. Lower build quality though.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db24hv9	2016-12-11 15:29:38	Christmas Laptop for a kid, $400 budget	t1_db24hv9	SuggestALaptop	t5_2s4k5	t3_5hqb4f

vjack11	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s probably not a way to make this work with the setup you have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You could use your computer&amp;#39;s HDMI output to send audio but it looks like your HTIB doesn&amp;#39;t have an HDMI input.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;You could use your computers analog 5.1 output (the 6 colored 3.5mm jacks) but your HTIB doesn&amp;#39;t have analog 5.1 input, only 2.0&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Your HTIB &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; support optical audio in, but as far as I can see your computer doesn&amp;#39;t have an optical audio jack (although sometimes one of the 3.5mm analog audio jacks can also serve as optical).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are determined to get this to work while spending as little money as possible, you could get a new sound card for your PC that has an optical audio output. (a.k.a. S/PDIF). E.g. at random &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-XONAR-Headphone-Audio-Card/dp/B003ZXDOL6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481470572&amp;amp;sr=8-2&amp;amp;keywords=sound+card+optical"&gt;here is a $29 one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The other solution would be to get a new AVR setup that has at least one HDMI input. That is by far the preferable solution if you care about good sound but you would have to replace the speakers as well so this could get expensive. Probably only worth it if you are willing to spend at &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; $500.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db24t4c	2016-12-11 15:38:40	[Help] 5.1 from PC to reciever?	t1_db24t4c	hometheater	t5_2rof6	t3_5hqisd

Once the tank is established and you do smaller water changes, I usually put the chemicals in as I&amp;#39;m filling from the tap.  But I know the parameters of our tap water and know exactly what will need to go in as far as pH balancing etc.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main thing is really just to monitor everything closely.  Check the water from your tap before you move the tank.  The nice thing about the python is that it aerates the water so that there isn&amp;#39;t as much chlorine before it hits the tank.  But you still need to add a water conditioner (I like Seachem Prime).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For the first adding of water, you want to preserve as much of the microscopic flora and fauna as possible.  In my original comment I didn&amp;#39;t add this, but don&amp;#39;t scrub the tank or remove the sand if you can because colonies of beneficial bacteria live there.  And then slowly add water of the proper temperature and acclimate your fish as slowly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db26o5w	2016-12-11 16:27:07	Moving 155 gallon tank	t1_db26o5w	aquarium	t5_2rf28	t1_db1zdjq

Swaginator_v2	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I drive a YJ and I&amp;#39;m super rough with it and often leave the top off. So I didn&amp;#39;t want to go with something too expensive. So I bought this cheap bar off amazon. Ripped out the shitty  6&amp;quot; and went with some marine Polk Audio. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s cheap, not the best build, but it the only one that would bolt up without affecting my head clearance and wouldn&amp;#39;t stretch my soft top. (frameless are so tight agaisnt the roll cage.) I was looking at some high dollar Marine audio bars on Amazon, but there&amp;#39;s not way I could mount it without sacrificing head space or going framed soft top. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ignore the reviews apart installation... I just used the included mounts, figured out which fit my YJ, and used self tapping screws and had it installed in less than an hour. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since I have no stereo, the front speakers are useless. But the bar (even before the Polk Audios) was 100x better than stock. Loud and clear to an extent. That&amp;#39;s when I removed the Chinese stockers inside the bar. They&amp;#39;d get distorted on high volume. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Volume is controlled on the bar itself or your phone. The LEDs are useless. But overall, I&amp;#39;m happy with it, and it actually doesn&amp;#39;t look awful once installed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FVZ9WH6/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_n4xtyb6S4BX22"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00FVZ9WH6/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_n4xtyb6S4BX22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t find the link for ebay, but I bought the exact one listed above on ebay as a &amp;quot;refurbished&amp;quot; for $170.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db26z32	2016-12-11 16:34:42	Please, it can unzip!	t1_db26z32	JeepMemes	t5_2vd7m	t1_db2464a

This will raise the glass bed up by 0.5mm and will prevent a warped aluminum bed from influencing the leveling process. Heat the bed up and clip some binder clips on the 4 corners over the thermal pads. Let it sit for a few minutes. This ensures the pads are compressed and in full contact with the 4 corners of the bed. Once you are ready to level the bead, the clips can be removed. The pads are sticky enough where the glass bed won&amp;#39;t slide off while printing. With a glass bed, you need to apply a material the plastic will still to. This can be a glue stick, Auqua Net hairspray(brand is important  &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aqua-Net-Unscented-Aerosol-Spray-11/dp/B002K33AFM"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Aqua-Net-Unscented-Aerosol-Spray-11/dp/B002K33AFM&lt;/a&gt;) or a sheet of PEI.

I take 4-5 at a time 2-3 times a day when I can tell I got glutened, and it does make the recovery time shorter. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Also--for future consideration--it&amp;#39;s always worth spitting it out if you realize it. Excuse yourself if you have to or just spit it into a napkin as discretely as possible. I work in a field that requires me to be at a lot of dinners and receptions, so I understand it can be awkward.

Yasea	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, the ads are for selling you stuff. Selling the stuff is done on the website that opens when you click. So they count clicks. They also count how many actually buy stuff after clicking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They would love more measurements for ads on a bus stop by measuring how many people are at the bus stop and a given time, and how many actually look at the ads. But that stuff is yet too expensive at the moment, but it will arrive very soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, you have the new &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=16008589011"&gt;amazon go shop without checkout&lt;/a&gt; where cameras automatically register what you buy. They also register when you reach for stuff, but don&amp;#39;t take it. Or look at an item and the system can see you are interested. Perhaps even link you watching the bus stop ad and you buying the product at that amazon shop later on. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db27j0h	2016-12-11 16:47:52	This has been happening a lot lately.	t1_db27j0h	AdviceAnimals	t5_2s7tt	t1_db24wwr

suprachromat	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve already played the base game it&amp;#39;s still worth picking up the Complete edition for $30, as HoS+BaW constitute pretty much a full game&amp;#39;s worth of content in and of themselves, especially BaW. And as usual, you can look forward to CDPR&amp;#39;s stellar storytelling and sidequesting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Considering most games these days have a (boring, linear) single player campaign of ~20 hours and boring as shit sidequests (lookin&amp;#39; at you Fallout 4), $30 for roughly 30 hours of main story content plus extras (don&amp;#39;t forget NG+), is not bad at all. ESPECIALLY since you&amp;#39;d be giving CDPR more money, which is absolutely not a bad thing as developers like them deserve to be showered with money. They are too few these days, instead we get shit &amp;quot;AAA&amp;quot; developers like Bethesda making shit and calling it an &amp;quot;RPG&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db28k7x	2016-12-11 17:12:41	[Amazon] The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Complete Edition - PC ($30)	t1_db28k7x	GameDeals	t5_2qwx3	t1_db248dv

The---Technician	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For what you will be doing with this laptop, I recommend one with a quad core i5 or i7 processor, 8 GB RAM or more, an SSD and of course, a dedicated graphics card.

It has a powerful quad core i7 processor, great 12 GB RAM, a nice 1 TB HDD and of course, a solid gtx 970 dedicated graphics card. Overall, this laptop will run all your CAD applications and run most games at very good settings. It has a solid keyboard and touch pad and a very nice display quality. All I would recommend is that you add an SSD to it later on to give you max speed.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db291c6	2016-12-11 17:23:49	Best Laptop for college?	t1_db291c6	SuggestALaptop	t5_2s4k5	t3_5hr0qa

You can put it on your face, then brush your teeth and do a couple chores while it dries (20 minutes) - I would do this once per day, at night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You will also need to buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Facial-Moisturizing-Lotion-Packaging/dp/B004TS06HG"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; - a regular moisturizer (for night time, after your BHA) and an SPF moisturizer (for daily sun protection; apply in the morning).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A cleanser would be really helpful too. At night, before your BHA treatment, do a quick cleanse with &lt;a href="http://www.cerave.com/our-products/cleansers/foaming-facial-cleanser"&gt;CeraVe Foaming&lt;/a&gt;. You can buy CeraVe products at Walmart, and get a coupon &lt;a href="http://www.cerave.com/coupons"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; as well. If the foaming one makes your skin too dry, they also have a Hydrating one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So your routine would be:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AM: Wash with water, apple CeraVe AM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;PM: Wash with cleanser, apply BHA (wait 20 minutes), apply CeraVe PM.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That is a simple basic routine that will actually be effective. You can&amp;#39;t really skip any steps because then it could make your skin worse. Obviously those products I listed are just suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db29jxp	2016-12-11 17:35:50	[Routine help] Starting, know nothing, what can I do that'll get me the most bang for my buck?	t1_db29jxp	SkincareAddiction	t5_2tbbg	t3_5hqn5o

LonerIM2	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend the Lenovo for school because of two things, first weight, 4.8 lbs is too much IMO to be carrying around on a daily basis for what might be hours on end, second it comes with lower res screen which is below standard even for this budget, I would suggest this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M18YU9I/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=lonerim2-20&amp;amp;linkId=a4f847f5eb97d8ffb47ce655898bef32"&gt;Acer 5&lt;/a&gt; because sometimes it goes on a deal for 499.99 so if you are not in a rush you can keep your eye on it until it drops, if you can&amp;#39;t wait then &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M18WT58/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=lonerim2-20&amp;amp;linkId=723c349048c1b8b1dc10dd5dea64a6e5"&gt;this lower config of it&lt;/a&gt; would be another good option, however it does come with 4 GB of ram only and we are not sure if it is upgradeable or not, or if you are ok with refurbished?(better value for money that way) then &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B01ER4ARCU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;condition=all&amp;amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;amp;tag=lonerim2-20&amp;amp;linkId=7cba991deb4f723fb26d3ea7f87a7a55"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; would be another good option because it has double the specs of the lower configured acer.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db29v7a	2016-12-11 17:42:55	$500 USA, Info Sys student use &amp; coding	t1_db29v7a	SuggestALaptop	t5_2s4k5	t3_5hq857

fkjac	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is safe from an electrical standpoint, in that it won&amp;#39;t cause a short circuit or anything like that (as long as you only connect each component to one PSU). The problem is that PSUs are normally made to turn on when the motherboard turns on, so you will have to short some pins on the 24 pin connector on the second PSU to get both PSUs to turn on at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is generally a better idea to buy a single, higher-wattage PSU, but many people have built multi-PSU computers. If you don&amp;#39;t know what you are doing I would advise against shorting wires yourself. There are some commercial options, like the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Add2PSU-Multiple-Power-Supply-Adapter/dp/B009P98Q8U"&gt;Add2PSU&lt;/a&gt;, that will turn on the second power supply for you, but in my opinion they are very over-priced for what they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db29w7w	2016-12-11 17:43:34	Is it safe to use one PC PSU and only connect it to GPU.	t1_db29w7w	AskTechnology	t5_2t6b3	t3_5hqh6u

At the same time, I would get a REAL appraisal for the property and see what it is worth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, after reading the book and seeing what it is worth, I would find out what it would cost to maintain the property as a rental per year. I would find out the rental revenue you could generate as well. Finally, if you choose to go down this road, how much it would cost to manage this rental since you can&amp;#39;t do it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After you figure out what the house is worth and your potential rental income, then you can make an informed decision. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Do you know a good resource for learning how to do a cost benefit analysis, or could you tell me how to conduct my own?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Start with the book above. I highly recommend it. You can buy a used copy for less than $3.00.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if you have specific questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2b6nb	2016-12-11 18:11:28	I just inherited a house.

It&amp;#39;s a good historical look at the effectiveness of various Arab militaries, though the section on Saudi Arabia is limited due to the lack of external conflict that it has participated in. I highly recommend this one. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you can try to find a copy of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Saudi-Arabia-Enters-Twenty-First-Century/dp/0275979970"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saudi Arabia Enters the Twenty-First Century: The Military and International Security Dimensions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Anthony Cordesman. It&amp;#39;s a pretty encompassing book of all things Saudi military and national security related. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you have access to it, read James Quinlivan&amp;#39;s article “Coup-Proofing:  Its Practice and Consequences in the Middle East” on how countries in the Middle East are structured to fight internal threats rather than external ones.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2byc2	2016-12-11 18:26:36	What are your thoughts on the future of Saudi Arabia?	t1_db2byc2	geopolitics	t5_2qhnn	t1_db22bao

Now, on a regular basis, during the day when you are going out, lug the bags out to your car, throw them in the trunk and go run your errands. Take them out of the car when you get home, repeat about 1-2 times a week. Make it look like you are going out for target practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have guns, though they are just for target shooting as a hobby, but I&amp;#39;ve also worked in some pretty sketchy neighborhoods and this works for me.

Pope-Urban-III	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;God speaks to His people through the Scriptures, as Catholics we believe the Old and New Testament to be inspired by the Holy Spirit, and so able to be called &amp;quot;the Word of God.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second question I don&amp;#39;t really know. Some of the Prophets pretty clearly talked to God and relayed what He said, others were writing down things that they may not have realized was inspired at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jesus is the Head of the Church, the Apostles are the first Bishops (and our Bishops are their successors), and the disciples are people who follow Christ.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last Prophet was John the Baptist, because prophecy points towards Christ, and after John came Christ Himself, so there can be no more prophecy. (This is why, technically, the prophecies in the New Testament are different from those in the Old; the new ones are pointing towards Christ&amp;#39;s Crucifixion or his Second Coming.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve heard &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lord-Romano-Guardini-ebook/dp/B007NJPRRC"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; is a good book, and I&amp;#39;ve also enjoyed &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Public-Life-Lord-Jesus-Christ/dp/0692411577"&gt;The Public Life of Our Lord Jesus Christ: An Interpretation&lt;/a&gt; which really opened the scriptures for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2cq3n	2016-12-11 18:41:41	Today I realized how uneducated I am with the Bible.

myexsparamour	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does sound like you and your husband may be sexually incompatible, but possibly you&amp;#39;re just both just inexperienced and unmotivated to develop the skills to be great lovers to each other. There are lots of books and tutorials that you could both use to make your sex life really mind-blowing and passionate, but you&amp;#39;d both need to be willing to work on it. It (probably) won&amp;#39;t get better if you are the only one who&amp;#39;s willing. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to go that route, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/She-Comes-First-Thinking-Pleasuring-ebook/dp/B000FC1PRK"&gt;She Comes First&lt;/a&gt; (for him) and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passionista-Empowered-Womans-Pleasuring-Kerner/dp/0060834390"&gt;Passionista&lt;/a&gt; (for you) are two books that get good reviews.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you communicate your concerns, but your husband really isn&amp;#39;t on board with working on this, you still might be able to make some progress by being more dominant in bed. You&amp;#39;ve been very vague and hesitant in expressing what you need up til now, and it sounds like your husband is on the submissive side. He may respond really well to you taking charge, if you can overcome your inhibitions (or not, it&amp;#39;s impossible to know until you try). But it&amp;#39;s also possible that you and he are sexually incompatible, and that he just doesn&amp;#39;t want the rougher, more passionate sex that would be satisfying for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2cv4l	2016-12-11 18:44:27	Lonely, sexually lost but in still in love.	t1_db2cv4l	DeadBedrooms	t5_2t25p	t3_5hrfji

There are several examples of this in the Tibetan history, for example, one of the most famous yogis was Milarepa who had attained complete enlightenment in one lifetime due to his total devotion to guru.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, if you really want to take a more serious approach to your practices, then it is highly recommended that you find a qualified teacher who you can trust and who can give you all the necessary methods to achieving enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, nobody can promise you that you will be able to achieve Buddhahood within one lifetime - it all depends on you. However, the methods of Mahayana/Vajrayana can lead to fast result if practiced properly and under the guidance of a skillful master.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It would be a good idea to check online if there are any local Buddhist centers in your area through which you could find such a teacher. Also, in order to understand how to develop relationships with a teacher on your path, I would suggest looking at this book by Jamgon Kongtrul Lodro Thaye: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Teacher-Student-Relationship-Jamgon-Kongtrul-Lodro/dp/1559390964"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Teacher-Student-Relationship-Jamgon-Kongtrul-Lodro/dp/1559390964&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2cxti	2016-12-11 18:45:54	How do I further my practice?	t1_db2cxti	Buddhism	t5_2qhnf	t3_5hohs1

yaboitinky	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;white nationalism&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;White nationalism is a very broad term. And historically it&amp;#39;s been associated with &amp;#39;white supremacy&amp;#39; over other groups.  However, that is not what the alt-right&amp;#39;s take on white nationalism is about. We believe race is real, race matters to people, and race is the foundation of identity. We want to raise consciousness among European people around the world to have solidarity and preserve their culture/societies. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Is it because white people have been told and taught to hate themselves simply for being white?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since the great march through the institutions in the 60&amp;#39;s by cultural marxists whites have been taught in education/media/etc. that &amp;quot;whiteness is a social construct&amp;quot; &amp;quot;race isn&amp;#39;t real&amp;quot; &amp;quot;pride in the accomplishment of your ancestors is white supremacy.&amp;quot; This has been coupled with mass immigration from low IQ third world countries into only white countries. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;white nationalist&amp;#39; seems like a really intense label.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been presented that way on purpose by the mainstream media. So many people in this world are benefitting from the rampant individualism and lack of solidarity that has taken hold of the white world. They don&amp;#39;t want a change in the status quo because that would mean that they wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to exploit the white world as easily as they are now. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2d1wu	2016-12-11 18:48:10	No Campus for White Men: The Transformation of Higher Education into Hateful Indoctrination	t1_db2d1wu	altright	t5_2rjzv	t1_db2cb39

GraphicNovelty	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, I would invest in a decent cookbook, because a lot of the recipes on the internet are garbage and you, as a new cook, won&amp;#39;t be able to separate the good vs. the bad. Any beginner&amp;#39;s cookbook is probably decent (How to cook everything, the joy of cooking, etc.) but &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Family-Cookbook-Americas-Test-Kitchen/dp/1936493853/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;refRID=Q0CKBHCEHD0Q1HC9BFJ0"&gt;america&amp;#39;s test kitchen&lt;/a&gt; is probably my recommendation, if only because the equipment reviews and ingredient tests are a boon to a home cook who is starting with little knowledge or equipment. Buying spices/basics when you need it is a good plan as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People on reddit in particular will also recommend the food lab book, which is a fine book on itself, or tell you to watch all of good eats but i&amp;#39;d recommend against both, as they both somewhat unnecessarily belabor the science aspect of cooking that, IMO, isn&amp;#39;t necessary to be a good chef. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2dotf	2016-12-11 19:00:33	Just moved out on my own, looking for advice!	t1_db2dotf	Cooking	t5_2qh7f	t3_5hrlry

Hamakua	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;IMO TW3 is definitely better.  I own both 1 and 2 - and can&amp;#39;t get through either because of how the controls work.  I&amp;#39;ve tried multiple times and wanted to like them because they story telling is great.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While TW3 isn&amp;#39;t the absolute best combat system I&amp;#39;ve played with - it is an order of magnitude better than TW 1 and 2.  It flows much better and it would be a dream come true if they ever remastered 1 and 2 and brought 3&amp;#39;s combat system/mechanics into them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do it - you don&amp;#39;t need to have played 1 and 2 to appreciate 90+% of the story and it&amp;#39;s one of the few games where the DLC is arguably BETTER than the main game (Hearts of stone specifically - both are huge and have their own charm).  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was in the same boat for TW1 and 2 as you.

jpw93	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;While evolutionary psychology is considered a &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; subfield of psychology, it has its origins in Charles Darwin&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt;. Darwin argues that, in the future, psychology will be based on a foundation which is, &amp;quot;of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation.&amp;quot; An excellent foundation for evolutionary psychology begins in &lt;em&gt;The Origin of Species&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regarding newer works, I would recommend Robert Wright&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moral-Animal-Science-Evolutionary-Psychology/dp/0679763996/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481482868&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=The+Moral+Animal%3A+Why+We+Are+the+Way+We+Are%3A+The+New+Science+of+Evolutionary+Psychology"&gt;The Moral Animal: Why We Are the Way We Are: The New Science of Evolutionary Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. This is an excellent encapsulation of how evolutionary psychologists primarily interpret moral behavior in both humans and non-human animals alike.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I would also check out Jerome Barkhow&amp;#39;s incredible work &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Adapted-Mind-Evolutionary-Psychology-Generation/dp/0195101073/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481482958&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=The+Adapted+Mind%3A+Evolutionary+Psychology+and+the+Generation+of+Culture"&gt;The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; I recommend this book if you&amp;#39;re looking to understand why human intelligence is fundamentally distinct from other species, and how evolutionary forces shaped human culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Happy reading!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2dyhm	2016-12-11 19:05:45	What are some 'must read' literature for someone interested in Evolutionary Psychology?	t1_db2dyhm	askpsychology	t5_2t0gc	t3_5hqt4t

narcsBgone	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Truthfully, I&amp;#39;ve never actually been seen by anyone about my PTSD beyond being prescribed Xanax and various antianxiety antidepressants. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ve treated the symptoms, but not the cause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I almost called a therapist the other day. But of course phone calls are too scary. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What about online therapy, via messaging?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also I&amp;#39;ve never had a particularly good experience with them. I was seeing one during my abuse and they didn&amp;#39;t pick up on it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Have you tried a trauma therapist? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like admitting I need help makes me weak and makes them the winner. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a false belief, not a feeling. If you need help, getting help to get your need for help met. You deserve to get your needs met.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All this to say, I feel dumb. Specifically emotionally dumb. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is perfectly ok. It&amp;#39;s not a block to getting help. Seek rational understanding, if you feel your emotions are blunted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Like I&amp;#39;m stuck in the mind if a twelve year old. I just can&amp;#39;t explain it other than sometimes I feel like a petulant teen-ager, but totally justified in my actions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This perfectly ok too. A good trauma therapist can work with this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My brain is just WRONG.\nI simply tell him to treat me like I&amp;#39;ve got a brain injury &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a result of trauma. It contains two sides; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some sense, those of us who lived through trauma in our childhoods, suffer &amp;#39;brain damage&amp;#39; of a sort. Our brains form in response to the trauma, which is not how the brains of those without trauma form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It leads us to believe we are forever brain damaged. However, this simply isn&amp;#39;t true. The brain is plastic and changes throughout our lives. We can heal ourselves from trauma. Although it isn&amp;#39;t trauma focused, you might want to check out the book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brain-That-Changes-Itself-Frontiers/dp/0143113100/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481482710&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=The+Brain+That+Changes+Itself%3A+Stories+of+Personal+Triumph+from+the+Frontiers+of+Brain+Science"&gt;The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science&lt;/a&gt;. This book is full of real life stories, as well as experiments, which repeatedly prove how capable the brain is of repairing itself, whether from strokes or far worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Will I ever feel safe again. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This I can&amp;#39;t say. I don&amp;#39;t feel safe myself. I was born into trauma and suffered it from birth to age 18. We can create safety for ourselves, but ultimately, there is no such thing as 100% safety at all times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Good god reading that last bit, I&amp;#39;m a fucking monster.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are no monster.

anthonybrothers	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same. I was tempted on the T150 at $125, but I was afraid it might be a downgrade to my Fanatec Porsche Carrera wheel. I saw this wheel hit $299, and the Amazon stock went from 9 to 3 in less than 10 minutes so I quickly threw it in my cart and ordered it. It has been a great wheel so far. I need to remember to register it right away though as I&amp;#39;ve heard good experience for customer service from those who&amp;#39;ve registered the product. Hopefully I never have to use the warranty, but it&amp;#39;s better to be safe than sorry. BTW, I&amp;#39;m mailing my Fanatec to a brother-in-law for Christmas, so hopefully he enjoys it as much as I did. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2ey0m	2016-12-11 19:24:06	[Controller] - Thrustmaster VG T300 Ferrari Alcantara Edition Racing Wheel $299.99 ($479.99 - $180)	t1_db2ey0m	buildapcsales	t5_2s3dh	t1_daj5lkt

CadHuevFacial	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I think the most basic of basic routines that worked for me for &lt;em&gt;years&lt;/em&gt; is using a very gentle facial cleanser and moisturizer every morning and every evening. That&amp;#39;s if you truly don&amp;#39;t want to have to use more than two products in your routine. Take time to peruse which cleansers/moisturizers are most recommended in this sub, then cross-check their ingredients with websites like the &lt;a href="http://www.goodguide.com/"&gt;Good Guide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.cosdna.com/"&gt;CosDNA&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily, most of the products loved by this sub are cost-effective and can generally fit most budgets. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re open to trying three steps/products, the most important/effective thing you could incorporate now that will have dramatic long-term impacts is a sunscreen. There are loads of sunscreens out there that are &amp;quot;cosmetically elegant&amp;quot;, which basically means they don&amp;#39;t resemble the greasy, white cast-leaving Banana Boat sunscreens we&amp;#39;re used to wearing at the pool making them easier to wear every day. I personally use &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Biore-JAPAN-Sarasara-SPF50-Sunscreen/dp/B00SM99KWU/ref=sr_1_2_s_it?s=beauty&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481483424&amp;amp;sr=1-2&amp;amp;keywords=biore+watery+essence"&gt;Biore Aqua Rich Watery Essence&lt;/a&gt; and have found it to work better than anything else I&amp;#39;ve ever tried. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since your routine is so bare, please be sure to take the time to slowly incorporate anything new into your routine so you can better track how new products are working for you. When forming a new skincare routine it is so so so important to take product recommendations with a big grain of salt until you build a foundational understanding of what kinds of products do and don&amp;#39;t work for you. This will take time, but it&amp;#39;ll pay off in the end. Additionally, I&amp;#39;ve found that just because a product doesn&amp;#39;t work well on my face doesn&amp;#39;t mean it has to go to waste. What causes breakouts for me on my face usually works wonders when used on my neck/chest/rest of my body. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, some good habits you can start  forming now include changing your pillow cases frequently, using clean towels to gently pat your face dry when you do wash it, and using super gentle and fragrance-free laundry detergents. Washing your face last when you&amp;#39;re in the shower is great too so you can ensure that residual shampoo/conditioner is washed away. In general, treating the skin on your face/neck gently and calmly is always going to be better than the alternative.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2f0wy	2016-12-11 19:25:36	[Routine help] Starting, know nothing, what can I do that'll get me the most bang for my buck?	t1_db2f0wy	SkincareAddiction	t5_2tbbg	t3_5hqn5o

anthonybrothers	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon reviews scared me a bit, but then I read a reddit post with many users praising the reliability. Others had great customer service experiences, and noted a bad batch of wheels early in the year (2016). So hopefully most of the horror stories I&amp;#39;ve read on Amazon are from that batch of wheels, and hopefully the customer support staff stepped up their game as seems true given some reports.

cx300	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the Ecobee most likely runs off of DC power. This will be supplied by a rectifier and a voltage regulator from the R terminal (24v AC from your HVAC equipment). 24v AC rectifies to about 35v DC. The ecobee will step this down to maybe 12 or 5v DC for use internally. So putting 24v DC on the R terminal should still work as expected, however it&amp;#39;s not recommended as it&amp;#39;s not a supported configuration. However, it shouldn&amp;#39;t cause damage. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To answer your questions, get a 24v AC transformer and relay that accepts a 24v AC signal and capable of switching 1v DC. Your circuit diagram looks correct. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looks like digikey does not have a wall transformer in stock. In short: the Ecobee needs ~4VA to run. Look for a transformer that can deliver at least 10va (or 10 watts) LockState Connect LS-24VAC 24 Vac Adaptor for LS-90i\n&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0071IWJ7G/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_hzAtybVP4AJ5X"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0071IWJ7G/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_hzAtybVP4AJ5X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/phoenix-contact/2903337/277-10089-ND/4755341"&gt;http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/phoenix-contact/2903337/277-10089-ND/4755341&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Double check me that these meet requirements. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2fa92	2016-12-11 19:30:42	Ecobee3 and millivolt system (transformer + relay setup) question	t1_db2fa92	ecobee	t5_37pn8	t3_5hmmud

DJSpook	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doubt is a good thing. We seem only capable of meaningfully using the things we loose. It let&amp;#39;s you see what this world is like without God...when you find Him again, you&amp;#39;ll be far more resolved and committed to following His plan for you. You&amp;#39;ll love Him even more, and cherish Him further. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As with any relationship, you can hardly trust God if you don&amp;#39;t know Who He is. Seek Him with all your heart, earnestly, and if He is truly Who He said He is then you should find Him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve drifted from reading the word, it feels difficult and dated. (Though, through great exegetical preaching, I know it isn&amp;#39;t dated at all.) &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Find God where you can encounter Him, one place would be His word. It is called the living word because it is always apt and basic to humanity. Unless human&amp;#39;s change (they haven&amp;#39;t), the word will still be relevant. The Gospel is still &lt;em&gt;news&lt;/em&gt;, it seems to me, I hope you&amp;#39;ll see that too. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/4t7gau/15_biblical_truths_every_christian_wishes_they/"&gt;I suggest you read this post I wrote for Christians that are struggling.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll try explaining some reasons I came to believe Christianity is true.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are some indications that I take to have theological significance. I recently asked Dr. Alexander Pruss of Baylor University, and he agreed that these each will derive, under honest and objective scrutiny, some epistemic justification for belief in God. But keep in mind: these can be put together--a hypothesis that solves 24+ problems has significant evidence in its favor, especially when it answers many of the most basic data in human experience (as you will see, existence itself, our moral experience, etc.). Each of these at least raise the probability of their respective theological conclusions, and raise the probability of the an ultimate theologically significant implication (such as &amp;quot;God exists&amp;quot;) such that theistic belief can be rationally founded when it is found in addition to something authenticating within Christianity. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Each time I employ natural theology on here someone gets on to me about making an appeal to ignorance, so...NOTE: there is a world of difference between appeals to ignorance, or a &amp;quot;God of the gaps&amp;quot; fallacy, and the best explanation for a phenomena we observe in the natural world. Science is, in fact, methodologically naturalistic--meaning it is inherently limited to naturalistic explanations. While I believe we should exhaust all plausible naturalistic explanations before moving on to supernaturalistic ones, keep in mind that science is derived entirely from philosophy, and maintains presuppositions which no scientific endeavor could substantiate. So these are attempts to derive metaphysical conclusions from naturalistic phenomena, and even due to the fact that they bear theologically significant implications, they are just as valid as scientific findings in that they are explanatory and represent an advance in knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bilimfelsefedin.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/God,_Design,_and_Fine-Tuning_-_Robin_Collins.pdf"&gt;The fine tuning&lt;/a&gt; of initial cosmological and subsequent universal conditions for the development of intelligent life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reasonablefaith.org/the-applicability-of-mathematics"&gt;The applicability of mathematics to the physical world.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://appearedtoblogly.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/the-argument-from-reason.pdf"&gt;The confluence of proper function and reliability of our cognitive faculties + The intentionality of conscious states of affairs + mental causation + the phycological relevance of logical laws&lt;/a&gt; &amp;lt;--part of what ran a train through my short-lived attestation to naturalism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://appearedtoblogly.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/linville-mark-22the-moral-argument22.pdf"&gt;Our moral experience&lt;/a&gt; (two arguments, usually).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://appearedtoblogly.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/maydole-robert-22the-ontological-argument22.pdf"&gt;The concept of God should not be a coherent idea unless He actually exists.&lt;/a&gt; There are varying modes of the advanced (modal) formulations of this argument, as with the moral argument. It makes use of the notion of &amp;quot;possible worlds,&amp;quot; however, some Thomistic philosophers with Aristotelean metaphysical assumptions would likely prefer &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aquinas-Beginners-Guide-Edward-Feser/dp/1851686908"&gt;Aquinas&amp;#39;s Five Ways,&lt;/a&gt; which I must admit have been defended very well recently since the fall of positivism and its attendant verification principle (the self-defeating idea that only what can be verified through the senses can be true. The reason I said it is self-referentially incoherent is that the very statement &amp;quot;only what can be verified through the sense is true&amp;quot; cannot be verified through the senses as being true). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.reasonablefaith.org/in-defense-of-the-kalam-cosmological-argument"&gt;The probable origin of the universe&lt;/a&gt;...I&amp;#39;m not so sure I agree with Dr. Craig on his philosophical argument against the existence of actual infinite from demonstrations of their incompatibility with certain scenarios (like a Hilbert&amp;#39;s Hotel thought-experiment), but I do think his other philosophical argument for the finitude of the past and the cosmological confirmations of it are impressive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://appearedtoblogly.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/pruss-alexander-22the-leibnizian-cosmological-argument22.pdf"&gt;The Leibnizian Cosmological Argument&lt;/a&gt; from contingency is probably the strongest of its family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://appearedtoblogly.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/kaiman-kwan-the-argument-from-religious-experience-blackwell-companion.pdf"&gt;The prevalence and universality of religious experience.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://appearedtoblogly.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/the-argument-from-consciousness.pdf"&gt;The development of consciousness&lt;/a&gt; from (if naturalism is true) inorganic matter seriously lacks a naturalistic explanation and means of creating one. NOTE: when looking into inferences from instantiations of biological complexity to an Intelligent Source, be careful to avoid what&amp;#39;s often called ID theory. It&amp;#39;s not philosophy, rather, I suspect it started with a few philosophically ignorant theologians and biologists. (In addition: first cell of life, linguistic properties of DNA...I&amp;#39;d say the former is more promising than the latter, though I haven&amp;#39;t looked into the latter much)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.proginosko.com/docs/The_Lord_of_Non-Contradiction.pdf"&gt;An argument from logical laws&lt;/a&gt;...this is fairly new, at least in terms of the attention it gets. I&amp;#39;ve worked some on my own version, though I&amp;#39;ve forgotten about this for a while now. I would change a few of their premises to be less radical and ground them back to the basics it starts with, though I think it still stands as a fair argument. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m out of room here, but that should help with your studying as you begin to evaluate these (hopefully you have the time). Don&amp;#39;t be overwhelmed, I know it&amp;#39;s a lot and they look intimidating but you can learn as you go. Stick with the moral argument and that from contingent being first, as they&amp;#39;re more approachable. I linked you from a reference volume on Natural Theology that I think is one of the better resources out there right now (on print, anyway). Many of the authors have blogs/websites and you can keep up with them there. Edward Feser&amp;#39;s blog isn&amp;#39;t included because, to his dismay, Thomism didn&amp;#39;t make the cut, but he has some great insights is one of the few prominent analytic philosopher of religion that can defend Aquinas&amp;#39;s Five Ways. &lt;a href="http://www.calvin.edu/academic/philosophy/virtual_library/articles/plantinga_alvin/two_dozen_or_so_theistic_arguments.pdf"&gt;Here are a few more&lt;/a&gt; that Alvin Plantinga (former president of the american philosophical association as well as the Society of Christina Philosophers, considered the most contributive philosopher of religion of his generation) finds promising/successful. &lt;a href="http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2011/07/so-you-think-you-understand.html"&gt;I would start with Feser&amp;#39;s article on Aquinas&amp;#39;s cosmological argument, given that he went for readability on this and those I linked to you are of another sort.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2fepg	2016-12-11 19:33:14	[prayer request] I've been struggling with doubt.	t1_db2fepg	TrueChristian	t5_2u489	t3_5hqc9w

Is there a certain number or range I should look for when I&amp;#39;m monitoring a network?  My home network signal seems to be hovering around -10 to 10.  I&amp;#39;ll look for a manual for the program later to better understand the information.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Can you recommend a usb wireless adapter that would improve my computers ability to capture wifi signals?  I have this one I tried at school: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-N150-Wireless-Adapter-TL-WN725N/dp/B008IFXQFU"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-N150-Wireless-Adapter-TL-WN725N/dp/B008IFXQFU&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it doesn&amp;#39;t help my problem at all and I&amp;#39;m willing to spend more money on a better one to solve my problems.  Would something like &lt;a href="https://www.thinkpenguin.com/gnu-linux/penguin-wireless-n-usb-adapter-w-external-antenna-gnu-linux-tpe-n150usbl"&gt;https://www.thinkpenguin.com/gnu-linux/penguin-wireless-n-usb-adapter-w-external-antenna-gnu-linux-tpe-n150usbl&lt;/a&gt; help me?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2gec9	2016-12-11 19:52:55	Wifi dropping when around a lot of wifi users	t1_db2gec9	techsupport	t5_2qioo	t1_db278ro
Praise_the_Tsun	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I loved the first Deus Ex and have definitely been wanting to pick this up. However I have a huge backlog to get through right now, so I&amp;#39;m weighing pros/cons. There&amp;#39;s a season pass for this right? Does anyone think there will be a GOTY version later that includes the DLC content? Also, does the DLC continue from the end of the story? I heard it cuts off quite abruptly and I couldn&amp;#39;t tell if that meant there was going to be a second game coming or the DLC would continue it (probably the former.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2gei4	2016-12-11 19:53:00	Deus Ex: Mankind Divided - $19.99 on Amazon	t1_db2gei4	PS4Deals	t5_2xja6	t3_5hr33t

sovereign007	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) Laptop with Thunderbolt port matching the enclosure you want to use. In your case a TB2 port for the Akitio Thunder2.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) The Akitio Thunder2 and the Video Card (duh :D )&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) A power supply to use with the Akitio and video card. For the GTX1060 you should be good with using a Dell DA-2 adapter (10-15$ off ebay). Note that you will need to mode connectors to it because the default connector of the DA-2 is not wired up in any way similar to any PC connector (despite looking like an 8-pin PCIe plug - It isn&amp;#39;t!). You will need to add a 5.5x2.5mm barrel plug connector to its outputs (to connect to the Thunder2&amp;#39;s power input), and a PCIe 6-pin plug to feed your video card&amp;#39;s 6-pin input. The alternative is to use a regular desktop power supply and mod a small molex to barrel plug connector to hook up to it in order to power the Thunder2. It is a lot bulkier, but tends to be easier to do (you can get away with no soldering, for example). I recommend a quality modular power supply in the 400W range. Modular because you won&amp;#39;t be using all of its cabling and you want to keep the cablepocalypse at bay :). Finally, in the case of an ATX PSU you need the means to power it up without a motherboard. You can build one yourself (it is easy), but if you want to get one prebuilt, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Supply-Bridge-Jumper-Lighted-Connector/dp/B01BFMFWB8/ref=pd_cp_23_4?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;pd_rd_i=B01BFMFWB8&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=NJGNNW65RYTACCBG0AND&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=RpD8t&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=uGby9&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;refRID=NJGNNW65RYTACCBG0AND"&gt;you can just get this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) In the BIOS you need to make sure that the Thunderbolt port is enabled. And that, if the option exists, it allows ANY Thunderbolt device to be connected.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2gfgl	2016-12-11 19:53:33	ROG G751JY with AKiTiO Thunder2 PCIe Box	t1_db2gfgl	eGPU	t5_2ukno	t1_db23qbg

The sentiment is most politely and concisely summed up by Pollan, but it was not new information discovered in 2009. The same sentiment could just as easily be written as &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t eat junk and processed foods, lots of fruit and vegetables, and if you&amp;#39;re fat just eat less.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Schwarzenegger&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Encyclopedia-Modern-Bodybuilding-Updated/dp/0684857219/ref=pd_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;refRID=ZBR8775W3NQGPJSAMH59"&gt;Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt; of Modern Bodybuilding was first published in 1980. The diet section starts by stating that all champions say that diet is the most important factor in their success. And of a 800 page book, only 30 pages are used to cover basic nutrition. In a book about people who diet as a major part of their profession, less than 5% is required to cover the most important part, because it simply is not that complicated. I don&amp;#39;t know what you were reading in 1987, but there&amp;#39;s plenty of nonsense fad diets still going around while the simple facts are available and have been for a long time, but there&amp;#39;s no headline or new book to sell with &amp;quot;Eat less move more, don&amp;#39;t eat junk.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2ghqm	2016-12-11 19:54:51	When space is tough, you gotta do what you gotta do.	t1_db2ghqm	facepalm	t5_2r5rp	t1_db2bt1o

malinny	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have really weak ankles as well. That + being overweight for 18 years and never building up certain muscles means that I am really prone to ankle rolls. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some things that have helped me: &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-I have &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/McDavid-Ankle-Brace-Stabilizer-Straps/dp/B01ITAPWQO/ref=pd_sim_200_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;pd_rd_i=B01ITAPWQO&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=QSYJ0F31QGH0KNDQ6BRF&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=vf4cW&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=xnD6h&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;refRID=QSYJ0F31QGH0KNDQ6BRF"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; ankle braces that I wear when I played rugby, am rock climbing, or doing rocky hikes. I always bring them backpacking with me although I don&amp;#39;t usually wear them. Ankle braces are good for stabilization as you build up muscles but I wouldn&amp;#39;t wear them all the time - especially for things like walking - because it makes your ankle reliant on the brace and it never builds up the necessary muscles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Spend a lot of time on your feet. You don&amp;#39;t have to be running but things like walking and challenging your foot to stabilize itself (walking on sand, grass etc) will make your ankle stronger and stronger&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-I went to physical therapy but stopped because $30 a session was too much for me. But take those exercises and do them on your own time. Use a bosu ball or couch cushion and just stand on it with one foot. &lt;a href="http://kylekranz.com/foot-ankle-routine/"&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is an ankle routine specifically for runners that I&amp;#39;ve been doing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-Go to a running store or podiatrist and tell them about your pain in flat shoes. The podiatrist gave me a pair of inserts that I wore in my running shoes for the first two years or so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The good news is that your body adapts and will build the necessary muscles the more you use it! My ankle is so much stronger compared to when I first started running. When you &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; roll your ankle it&amp;#39;s terrifying but those are actually the times your ankle really learns to restabilize itself. You don&amp;#39;t have to force it but things like balancing or unstable terrain can be really good to build up those muscles...just be careful! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In regards to running, find a program and do it. Don&amp;#39;t push your body too hard. If you haven&amp;#39;t been running consistently as your body has been growing then it&amp;#39;s new (and stressful) for your body - give it time to catch up!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2gv0n	2016-12-11 20:02:02	Running for beginners?	t1_db2gv0n	xxfitness	t5_2ryzy	t3_5hpxmk

zincfoam	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;#39;s be clear: there are no jobs to &amp;quot;bring back&amp;quot; - the majority of labor jobs lost have been to process automation and technology. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It takes less people to produce more output now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A great example of this is Bethlehem Steel, which used to employ 10&amp;#39;s of thousands. Today, smaller mills produce the same amount of steel, of higher quality, and in less time. An mostly automated bread factory can produce 60,000 loves of bread a day (and more) with about 100 people. To produce the same amount 30 years ago would have required over 500 people. That&amp;#39;s just process automation. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;#39;s simple elimination of jobs due to other technologies.&lt;br/&gt;\nConsider the effect of email. \nWhen I started in the workplace, there was a mail room. This was staffed by 10 people, and their sole job was to walk around on each floor collecting inter-office mail, sorting it and delivering it. They came around 4 times a day, first in the morning, then right before lunch, then right after lunch then at about 3:45. Now, back then, if you needed to write a letter to someone, you called your secretary. You dictated a letter to her (and it was always a &amp;quot;her&amp;quot;) - she would then either type it up for you or send - via inter-office mail - her notes and it would go to a secretarial pool - about 40 or 50 women who would type things up. You&amp;#39;d get a copy back in inter-office mail, sign it, and have your secretary mail it out, or if it were urgent, you&amp;#39;d call a messenger (from the mail room) who would come take the typed letter, and hand-carry it across the city to the destination, where the same basic process would happen. First we had faxes, and that got rid of the messengers. Then we got word processors and that got rid of the steno pool. Then we got email. And that eventually got rid of the mail room and the messengers and so on. And nothing replaced them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, that happened. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s get back to MAKING STUFF - the holy grail of the whole &amp;quot;MAGA&amp;quot; movement, I think, is to have low skill, well-paying jobs &amp;quot;returned&amp;quot; to the USA. But take that apart - low skill is one thing, but the well-paying part. That&amp;#39;s where the challenge is. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You see, back when jobs were plentiful, the things you expect to get cheap today at the store were, relatively, expensive.  Let&amp;#39;s use Radio Shack as an example. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/index_general.html"&gt;http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/index_general.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a stereo system from  the 1969 catalog - page 21 -  the Scott 300/C - it was $199. That&amp;#39;s about $413 in today&amp;#39;s dollars.  Go to amazon today, and you have a FAR better device for under $100 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pyle-PDA5BU-Bluetooth-Amplifier-Receiver/dp/B00LI4L1LO/ref=sr_1_6?s=electronics&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481483872&amp;amp;sr=1-6&amp;amp;keywords=pyle+receiver"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Pyle-PDA5BU-Bluetooth-Amplifier-Receiver/dp/B00LI4L1LO/ref=sr_1_6?s=electronics&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481483872&amp;amp;sr=1-6&amp;amp;keywords=pyle+receiver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why is it cheap? Well it&amp;#39;s built mostly by robots, which cost about $8 an hour to run (24/7). And where it&amp;#39;s touched by humans, they are also cheap - in fact far less than $8 an hour, more like $1.50 an hour. Let&amp;#39;s say there are 10 robots and 3 people needed to run a production line. So, to grossly over simplify, you&amp;#39;re spending $84.50 an hour to have a single line running and that line can produce 50 radios an hour with $1.69 in labor costs per radio.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, leaving the cost of the materials to build the amplifier out of things (which is actually a big factor due to other factories that produce parts being closer together in china), let&amp;#39;s move the jobs back to the USA. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s pay the robot-watchers in the new factory the equivalent of what an unskilled laborer made at Bethlehem Steel in the 1960&amp;#39;s - in today&amp;#39;s dollars that works out to $21 an hour (we can go on and on about wages and why the value of automation wasn&amp;#39;t shared with labor...but we won&amp;#39;t). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, now, your production line costs you $143.00 an hour to run (again horribly, horribly over simplified). Assuming your supply chain of materials is as efficient as it was in China, you are still producing 50 radios per line per hour, but now you&amp;#39;re spending $2.86 a radio to produce it. Maybe you can still package, deliver and service radios and make a profit at that cost. Maybe. But let&amp;#39;s be clear - if you can add a single robot and reduce the number of robot watchers to 2 - well, now you&amp;#39;re sort of competitive, but you&amp;#39;ve only created 2 jobs. And if your profitability is low because you&amp;#39;re paying people more, you can&amp;#39;t afford that 11th robot, but the radio factory down the road paying only $9.00 an hour can. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The point, and I want to drive this home firmly and completely - there are no jobs to bring &amp;quot;back&amp;quot; - those old jobs are simply not economically viable here or are self-eradicating via automation. Focus on the future, not the past. The past is dead. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is PLENTY of work to be had in the USA right this moment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, it&amp;#39;s too much low-stability, low-skill, low-paid work (Want fries with that?) or low-stability, high-skill, high paid work (Nobody needs PHP or  SQL people anymore, now it&amp;#39;s all Hadoop. Wait? now it&amp;#39;s Haskell? no wait...Swift? now its NoSQL? What? I just went out to eat....), but in-between those extremes, there are jobs to be had. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The jobs probably won&amp;#39;t be in the place you grew up. They won&amp;#39;t be in the industry your father was in. You won&amp;#39;t have the same benefits your parents had. You might not have the house and 2 cars. You will have to be trained and retrained and retrained just to keep working. Your skills will be rendered obsolete constantly unless you constantly keep updating them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of obsessing with bringing back the inefficient, obsolete and filthy industries of yore, a whole lot of people would do quite a bit better if they just let go of the past and moved into the present and future.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2gzfv	2016-12-11 20:04:32	If we started making things back in the USA they say the prices will go up and not by a few cents, can somebody briefly explain why bringing jobs back to the USA is a bad thing and why prices will rise?	t1_db2gzfv	TrueAskReddit	t5_2s91q	t3_5gt17v

Notaurious	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would not suggest the Raspberry Pi. If they are a tech lover, it&amp;#39;s likely they already have one. I would suggest this particular Arduino set: (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D8KOZF4/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;smid=A2WWHQ25ENKVJ1"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D8KOZF4/ref=ox_sc_sfl_title_2?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;smid=A2WWHQ25ENKVJ1&lt;/a&gt;). It has lots of nifty pieces that they can do a lot with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another thing I noticed on EpicGifts list is the Amazon Echo - If they have prime and are a big amazon person, then go with the Echo, or Echo Dot. However, if they are more integrated into google, I would recommend the Google Home (&lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/google_home"&gt;https://store.google.com/product/google_home&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other then that, I would be careful on different gadgets (Phones/Watches/Tablets/ect). Most tech lovers are bias to specific brands, and like to do a lot of deep research before purchasing an electronic. So might want to ask them some general branding questions first. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Outside of that, if none of that interests you, tech lovers love random gadgets. For example, if they have pets - maybe something like the petcube would be great for them (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Petcube-Camera-Video-2-Way-Built/dp/B00JGWN8O8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481486893&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=petcube"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Petcube-Camera-Video-2-Way-Built/dp/B00JGWN8O8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481486893&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=petcube&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just browse a bit and keep those things in mind.

Morrinn3	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calm your tits, madam.&lt;br/&gt;\nDid I say Bethesda sucked? I did say that gamebryo is an unstable mess, because it is. Its also a highly adaptable one with some of the most vibrant modding community around, which extends the game&amp;#39;s lifespan long past it&amp;#39;s would be expiration date.&lt;br/&gt;\nDid I shit on Fallout 3? I mentioned that story wise it paled in comparison to New Vegas. You read into that how you please.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And my fawning over CDPR? Well, this is a thread where we were talking about Blood and Wine, and I thought it was an interesting point that it has become noteworthy when a massive triple-A game is released and it &lt;em&gt;doesn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; require a hotfix in the first week to fix some big game-breaking issue. It used to be that shit like that happened it was considered scandalous, nowadays its an industry standard.     &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why does everyone have to draw a line in the sand and claim that its US and THEM. Either you are a FANBOY or a HATER. If you like something its a circlejerk, if you criticize something its a brigade.     &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or maybe I was just having a conversation with &lt;a href="/u/MysterD77"&gt;/u/MysterD77&lt;/a&gt; and expressing my opinion.

not-moses	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the modern world. Here&amp;#39;s a rundown of suggested actions to get into to take care of &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; so that you can take care of your children:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) Read this article on the &lt;a href="http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-five-stages-of-recovery.html"&gt;five stages of recovery&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;, seeing where she is among those five stages.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Read this article on the &lt;a href="http://coda.org/index.cfm/newcomers/patterns-and-characteristics-of-codependence/"&gt;patterns &amp;amp; characteristics&lt;/a&gt; of codependency about you &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3) Read about the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=karpman%20drama%20triangle"&gt;Karpman Drama Triangle&lt;/a&gt; about you and her, and her and her other, original family members.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Learn about &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=family+secrets+psychology"&gt;family secrets&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=emotional+blackmail"&gt;emotional blackmail&lt;/a&gt; used to protect them, because it is typical in the childhood families of adult survivors. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) Read about &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=reactive+attachment+disorder"&gt;reactive attachment disorder&lt;/a&gt;, because it is usually what the child acquires when abused by those she must depend upon to survive. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6) Look for &lt;a href="http://locator.coda.org/"&gt;CoDA meetings&lt;/a&gt; in your area and go to six before making a decision to continue or not... because it is likely that you will need to know about &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=psychological+boundaries"&gt;psychological boundaries&lt;/a&gt; and how to raise and lower them appropriately as your wife struggles with -- and seems to flip back and forth from -- fear of abuse here and fear of abandonment there.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7) Look over &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=books%20adult%20survivors%20of%20child%20abuse"&gt;these books&lt;/a&gt;, pick one or two, and read it about you &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8) Look over &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Borderline-Personality-Disorder-Survival-Guide/dp/1572245077/ref=sr_1_fkmr3_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1479758295&amp;amp;sr=1-1-fkmr3&amp;amp;keywords=Alexander+Chapman+Kim+Gratz+Borderline"&gt;this link to this book&lt;/a&gt;, get the book, and work through it for your own sake, regardless of whether or not she has BPD (it can be induced by medicine and hormone changes), as well as what she does or doesn&amp;#39;t do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9) Come to understand that she may have &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=borderline+personality+disorder"&gt;BPD&lt;/a&gt; as a coping system for the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=c-ptsd"&gt;C-PTSD&lt;/a&gt; that is typical among adult survivors. BPD is a set of dysfunctional -- but understandable -- coping mechanisms for untreated child abuse and resulting C-PTSD. The best psychotherapies for it are those that understand the causes resulting in and physiological conditions of a shredded &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=autonomic+nervous+system"&gt;autonomic nervous system&lt;/a&gt; no longer capable of managing her &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=fight+flight+freeze"&gt;fight-flight-freeze&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot; response to perceived threat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10) &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=dialectical+behavior+therapy"&gt;DBT&lt;/a&gt; is the current gold standard for managing the emotions and behaviors that come with BPD &amp;amp; complex PTSD. She can find people in her area who know how to administer it through &lt;a href="http://behavioraltech.org/index.cfm?CFID=53962983&amp;amp;CFTOKEN=86772797"&gt;Behavioral Tech&lt;/a&gt;, and even adjunct therapy &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=DBT+therapy+workbooks"&gt;workbooks like these&lt;/a&gt;. One can also get a lot of support from &lt;a href="http://www.dbtselfhelp.com/"&gt;DBT Self-Help&lt;/a&gt; and organizations like &lt;a href="https://groups.psychologytoday.com/rms/prof_results.php?state=NJ&amp;amp;spec=488"&gt;DBT-NJ&lt;/a&gt;, so dig around for them online, but advise her not to try to &amp;quot;get well&amp;quot; on the cheap.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;11) &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=emdr%20therapy"&gt;EMDR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_Experiencing"&gt;SEPt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=Hakomi+Mindfulness-Centered+Somatic+Psychotherapy"&gt;BCP/MCSP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-10-steps-ogdens-sensorymotor.html"&gt;SP4T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.drlaurenceheller.com/Intro_to_NARM.html"&gt;NARM&lt;/a&gt; are the most widely research-supported therapies for the &lt;em&gt;causes&lt;/em&gt; of BPD and C-PTSD. In time, she may need one of more of these to clean up the lingering residues and rewire her &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=limbic+system"&gt;limbic emotion regulation system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have myself recovered from BPD, severe anxiety, compensatory mania, suicidality and other upshots of complex PTSD by using Ogden&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-10-steps-ogdens-sensorymotor.html"&gt;SP4T&lt;/a&gt; as the 9th of the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing"&gt;10 StEPs of Emotion Processing&lt;/a&gt; in the fifth stage of my recovery, as well as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy"&gt;REBT&lt;/a&gt;, collegiate &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking"&gt;critical thinking&lt;/a&gt;, several of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"&gt;CBTs&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_processing_therapy"&gt;CPT&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=schema+therapy"&gt;schema therapy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=emdr%20therapy"&gt;EMDR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=dialectical+behavior+therapy"&gt;DBT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=mindfulness-based+cognitive+therapy"&gt;MBCT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=acceptance+%26+commitment+therapy"&gt;ACT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.newharbinger.com/blog/introduction-mind-body-bridging-i-system"&gt;MBBT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=mindfulness+based+stress+reduction+therapy"&gt;MBSR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_Experiencing"&gt;SEPt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=Hakomi+Mindfulness-Centered+Somatic+Psychotherapy"&gt;HBCT&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.drlaurenceheller.com/Intro_to_NARM.html"&gt;NARM&lt;/a&gt; in the fourth.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2hj7n	2016-12-11 20:15:04	I need help, my wife had a break down today	t1_db2hj7n	mentalhealth	t5_2qirg	t3_5hoosr

schorhr	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, a trunk can be a limiting factor :-) A dobsonian usually fits on the back seat, for everything else -&amp;gt; measure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For $450 you can get a 6&amp;quot; on EQ mount, but the stability is not good. As for size, specifically see these links&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;6&amp;quot; on sturdy EQ mount VS 8&amp;quot; dobsonian -&amp;gt; &lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IkaRJWvFN8Q/UJgCBeDBrHI/AAAAAAAABj8/oyOf2xo8bBs/s1600/6f5_8f6.jpg"&gt;Image&lt;/a&gt; (source: &lt;a href="http://taunus-astronomie.blogspot.de/2007/03/teleskope-im-groenvergleich.html"&gt;Taunus-Astronomie&lt;/a&gt;, German)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.astropetes.com.au/telescopes.html"&gt;Overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 6&amp;quot; has a smaller pack-size, but is less stable and shows less.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are also the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sky-Watcher-8-Collapsible-Dobsonian-Telescope/dp/B004Q78OII/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1477808882&amp;amp;sr=8-6&amp;amp;keywords=Collapsible+skywatcher"&gt;collapsible&lt;/a&gt;/flextube and Lightbridge dobsonians if it&amp;#39;s just about packing size. Perhaps you can get a used 10&amp;quot; within your budget.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course you can take nice snapshots of the moon and planets (with a bit of patience) using a manual telescope :-)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Celestron 6se costs over your budget, but the SLT 5&amp;quot;  could still be nice if you can&amp;#39;t take a 8&amp;quot; dobsonian and can live with the 5&amp;quot; Maksutov&amp;#39;s limitations. It&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Celestron-NexStar-127SLT-Mak-Computerized/dp/B0038LX8XE/ref=sr_1_6?s=electronics&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1436126004&amp;amp;sr=1-6&amp;amp;keywords=maksutov"&gt;back in stock&lt;/a&gt; for $439, leaving a bit of money for a decent eyepiece or two. It&amp;#39;s more your typical &amp;quot;balcony telescope&amp;quot; for planets, it&amp;#39;s a bit limited regarding deepsky and especially wide-field. Without power, it can&amp;#39;t be moved. But as it&amp;#39;s only ~$40 more expensive than a 5&amp;quot; Mak without mount, it&amp;#39;s a nice freeby. A sturdy camcorder mount can be used as manual alternative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also the Starblast 6&amp;quot; table-top, but it costs almost as much as a 8&amp;quot;, and isn&amp;#39;t as compact as the 5&amp;quot; table tops anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2htta	2016-12-11 20:20:45	Help!

SirCheesington	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well then, before you take on any Gameboy soldering, you should get a kit like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elenco-AmeriKit-Learn-Solder-Kit/dp/B0009Z3JJA"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and practice.

PleySteshon	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been dreaming of having scuf controller for playing mainly on CoD series. But $200 isn&amp;#39;t cheap for controller... Recently I stumbled upon a post here about PS4 Strikepack, which is cheap made plastic add on to controller which gives extra 2 paddles for mapping.  Only $40US dollars.  WTH? I&amp;#39;ll try... and got one from local Gamestop.  Ever since... I&amp;#39;m using one of the paddle as jump, for jump shots... my K/D has improved from 0.2 to 0.5!!!  I&amp;#39;m  no representative nor advertiser.  Just wanted to share how much simple paripheral add on can improve gaming.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But... I have to admjt... this can be OP and unfair to one&amp;#39;s who don&amp;#39;t own one... but for anyone who sucks in CoD can definitely benefit from this. And... let not limit it to CoD players only.  This can be helpful to all other games.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Another features this addon gives are some mods... which I strongly disagree adding this feature first place... and anyone using this addon should never use them.  Many features will get you banned from PS4 multiplayer as they are not acceptable.  So please note this post is NOT for someone who wants to exploit gaming environment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amazon had this out of stock for some time:\n&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Collective-Dominator-Controller-Adapter-playstation-4/dp/B01L8QHXJA"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Collective-Dominator-Controller-Adapter-playstation-4/dp/B01L8QHXJA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2j85x	2016-12-11 20:46:50	My Scuf replacement.

-voteforPepe-	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a (now reformed) felon and I spent most of my criminal days trying to look like I wasn&amp;#39;t up to anything. To not arouse suspicion. Most felons/&amp;quot;thugs&amp;quot; have a drug problem and only really attract women who also have a drug problem which carries a lack of commitment with it usually. I think you&amp;#39;re misunderstanding some things. A man can (and should) demand respect through his demeanor, by being a &amp;quot;closed book,&amp;quot; by making the right choices, by being assertive, etc.  One of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/48-Laws-Power-Robert-Greene/dp/0140280197"&gt;48 Laws of Power&lt;/a&gt; is to always obey the law. You cannot be a powerful individual and also a criminal because the rest of society automatically has power over you when you are breaking laws. Based on your posts I think you&amp;#39;d like to read that book, and mighty clarify the difference between a thug (who is alpha in his circle of convicts and trashy women) and a true Alpha Male who commands respect from everyone around him. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2jia5	2016-12-11 20:52:10	Ultimate alpha vibe	t1_db2jia5	TheRedPill	t5_2ve1u	t1_db2hi9h

keith0718	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be bad if you weren&amp;#39;t apprehensive. Your fear is a good sign that you respect the inherent dangers of motorcycling . I was in a somewhat similar situation - this time last year I was set on getting into motorcycling when I ran into the statistic that one is 30 times more likely to die on a bike that in a car. I got spooked. I did some research and after reading David Hough&amp;#39;s book, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Proficient-Motorcycling-Ultimate-Guide-Riding/dp/1620081199/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8"&gt;Proficient Motorcycling&lt;/a&gt; I was confident that &amp;quot;it is possible to reduce the risks of motorcycling to an acceptable level through skill and knowledge&amp;quot;, as Hough states in the introduction. But you really have to study the risks (through books like Hough&amp;#39;s) and develop the skills and habits to avoid them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ended up starting on a 2014 Honda CB500F. I&amp;#39;m glad I didn&amp;#39;t start on a 250, but there was one occasion where a bigger bike would have gotten me in trouble. You should be fine on a 650. Just be careful; don&amp;#39;t throw yourself out there in situations that will require a skill set you haven&amp;#39;t yet developed. Read books like Hough&amp;#39;s so you know what&amp;#39;s coming at you and the stupid things you should avoid. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2jqyg	2016-12-11 20:56:31	Help I think I'm a wimp.	t1_db2jqyg	NewRiders	t5_3hdbs	t3_5hphxg

SamPeppersDissTrack	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Review\n&amp;quot;Just wanted to say thank you for these books! My 8-year-old son is now very interested in reading and really looks forward to reading your books. He loves your books and has now become a willing reader on his own. Thank you again!&amp;quot;\nTeresa C, Buffalo Grove IL&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Stinky Steve: Book One - A Minecraft Mishap by PT Evans is a fun book, great for kids and perhaps the odd adult among us as well. Even if you have never seen Minecraft, let alone played it, you will enjoy this book and kids will love it too, especially the great illustrations that pepper the book and bring it to life. Let&amp;#39;s face it, all kids find farting funny and this is the perfect subject for the perfect book, although if you aren&amp;#39;t familiar with Minecraft, some of the language used may be a little lost on you. It matters not; this is a funny book that is incredibly well written and all kids will love it to the extent that they will want to read it over and over again. Loved it, looking forward to reading book 2!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\n5 Star Review by Anne-Marie Reynolds for Readers&amp;#39; Favorite\nAbout the Author\nP. T. Evans loves Minecraft, pizza, emojis, cats, and fart jokes. When he’s not writing or doing author visits, he is training alligators and sumo wrestling.

JelzooJim	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst Grav does come across as harsh sometimes, he is right, and he does it because he cares. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are obviously passionate about your book, and of course you should be, but it &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; fail because you&amp;#39;ve failed at the fundamentals. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Readers are like magpies, they like something pretty and shiny. Your book is neither, and screams amateur. I wrote a blog post on the importance of cover design - &lt;a href="http://jelzoo.com/blog/publishing/item/36-people-really-do-judge-a-book-by-its-cover"&gt;People really do judge a book by its cover - First impressions count&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#39;ll be worth the read. It has examples and tips. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aside from the cover, which can make or break a book, an editor is worth their weight in gold. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just those two things will at least give you a chance of making a success of your book. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an article I wrote on how to write a good blurb - &lt;a href="http://jelzoo.com/blog/promoting/item/53-blah-blah-blah-dos-and-don-ts-to-turn-the-back-of-your-book-from-dreary-blah-to-successful-blurb"&gt;http://jelzoo.com/blog/promoting/item/53-blah-blah-blah-dos-and-don-ts-to-turn-the-back-of-your-book-from-dreary-blah-to-successful-blurb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are some articles on editing tips - &lt;a href="http://jelzoo.com/blog/promoting/itemlist/tag/Editing"&gt;http://jelzoo.com/blog/promoting/itemlist/tag/Editing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t invest in your book, why would you expect a reader to?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you need any advice on cover design, formatting, etc, don&amp;#39;t hesitate to give me a shout, I&amp;#39;m always happy to help.

In addition, their battery life slowly drains over time even when not in use. You have to be obsessive about charging the things because if you don&amp;#39;t charge them in anticipation of going to the gym or doing some shopping for a few hours, then the battery dies and you can&amp;#39;t listen to music or podcasts anymore. Not to mention, &lt;strong&gt;wireless headphones serve no purpose&lt;/strong&gt;. There is absolutely no reason to buy them unless your headphone jack dies like mine did.

Yst	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t see the point.  Boxes make games harder to display, store, and use.

not-moses	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well.

in which I lived when my defenses failed me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Support Groups: &lt;a href="http://www.aa.org/"&gt;AA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.marijuana-anonymous.org/"&gt;MA&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=narcotics+anonymous"&gt;NA&lt;/a&gt; if one is using intoxicants to try to cope with emotional pain; &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=adult+children+of+alcoholics"&gt;ACA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=emotions+anonymous"&gt;EA&lt;/a&gt;

websites including Mayo Clinic, WebMD, NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health), NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness), and even Wikipedia (when everything asserted is solidly documented with citations). &lt;em&gt;Accurate&lt;/em&gt; information is power. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4) Psychotherapy: I currently use Ogden&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="http://pairadocks.blogspot.com/2016/07/the-10-steps-ogdens-sensorymotor.html"&gt;SP4T&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=interoception+meditation"&gt;interoceptive&lt;/a&gt; 9th of the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=10+StEPs+of+Emotion+Processing"&gt;10 StEPs of Emotion Processing&lt;/a&gt;, but had good results over the years with several of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy"&gt;CBTs&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_emotive_behavior_therapy"&gt;REBT&lt;/a&gt;, collegiate &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking"&gt;critical thinking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_processing_therapy"&gt;CPT&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=schema+therapy"&gt;schema therapy&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=emdr%20therapy"&gt;EMDR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=dialectical+behavior+therapy"&gt;DBT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=mindfulness-based+cognitive+therapy"&gt;MBCT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=acceptance+%26+commitment+therapy"&gt;ACT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.newharbinger.com/blog/introduction-mind-body-bridging-i-system"&gt;MBBT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=mindfulness+based+stress+reduction+therapy"&gt;MBSR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#q=Hakomi+Mindfulness-Centered+Somatic+Psychotherapy"&gt;HBCT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_Experiencing"&gt;SEPt&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.drlaurenceheller.com/Intro_to_NARM.html"&gt;NARM&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To find the clinicians who know how to use these psychotherapies, look &lt;a href="https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://doctor.webmd.com/find-a-doctor/specialty/psychiatry"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and (for DBT specialists in particular) &lt;a href="http://behavioraltech.org/resources/crd.cfm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If you dig a little on each page, you will be able to see which therapies they use. Most MD / psychiatrists, btw, are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; therapists themselves (they are medication specialists), but can refer you to those who are, and are often -- though not always -- excellent sources of referral. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5) Mindfulness Meditation: Try the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vipassan%C4%81"&gt;Vipassana&lt;/a&gt;-style? (For a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of people with anxiety, this stuff handles anxiety chop chop. Not sure about depression. Many of the modern psychotherapies for anxiety are actually based on it now.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6) Therapy Workbooks: I got a lot of lift-off by using inexpensive workbooks like &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=stanley+block+mind+body+bridging+therapy+workbooks"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=CBT+workbooks"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=ACT+therapy+workbooks"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;amp;ion=1&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8#safe=off&amp;amp;q=DBT+therapy+workbooks"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7) Moderate exercise: Because it is the single healthiest of the distractions one can use to yank oneself out of the paradigm for a while... &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; it can help to &amp;quot;massage&amp;quot; the brain so that it responds more quickly to psychotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8) Medications, but &lt;em&gt;only if really needed&lt;/em&gt; to get one stabilized enough to do the previous seven things on this list: Find a board certified psychopharmacologist in your area by using the clinician locator on the &lt;em&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/em&gt; website. Getting psych meds from a GP or primary care doc can be useless or even risky. Psych diagnoses, meds and med interactions are just too complex now for most GPs and primary care docs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2m4kj	2016-12-11 21:41:20	Can someone please help me make sense of all this?

On Tuesday I should be receiving two brand new &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Curved-24-Inch-Monitor-C24F390/dp/B01CX26WPY/ref=sr_1_8?s=pc&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481492612&amp;amp;sr=1-8&amp;amp;keywords=curved+monitor"&gt;monitors&lt;/a&gt; to replace them. Wish I could say it was only a couple day&amp;#39;s work like many of the people below.. but nope, this was about a year&amp;#39;s worth of work for me (like I said, I&amp;#39;m a casual turker).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2m9r0	2016-12-11 21:44:15	How Has MTurk Helped You Financially?	t1_db2m9r0	mturk	t5_2qmd7	t3_5hildv
ocinn	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I made these with the radians kit:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Radians-CEP001-Custom-Molded-Earplugs/dp/B003A28P4I"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Radians-CEP001-Custom-Molded-Earplugs/dp/B003A28P4I&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Simply follow the instructions (I used half as much material as they said I should, as 1) I have small ears, 2) much of the extra material is being taken up by the IEM)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then put a cotton wad in the sound tube of the IEMs (to prevent material from going in)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Put IEM&amp;#39;s in (without eartip) after inserting putty into ears.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wait 10 min to cure. Remove from ears and drill out sound tube.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cut the tube to length. The longer it is the more bass you have, and it attenuates the highs. Shorter is more neutral. I cut them short.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall the comfort went up 200%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My right ear must be funny because the seal wasn&amp;#39;t as good with both IEM&amp;#39;s on that side. I fixed it by using some silicone sealant and a paintbrush to adjust the fit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Works great and I recommend trying it if you have $10.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2mbjx	2016-12-11 21:45:18	I can't afford CIEMs, so I did the next best thing - make my own	t1_db2mbjx	headphones	t5_2rcyx	t3_5hsln9

fletcherhub3	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looks like a great build, with that bit of extra cash, you could get an i5 6500 (better clock speeds).

To squeeze an SSD in there, you could save a bit of money with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/MasterBox-Mid-tower-Computer-Configuration-positions/dp/B01HDUVMBU/ref=sr_1_2?s=pc&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481492663&amp;amp;sr=1-2&amp;amp;keywords=masterbox"&gt;MasterBox 5&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NZXT-S340-Tower-CA-S340W-W1-White/dp/B00NGMIBXC/ref=sr_1_1?s=pc&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481492700&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=s340"&gt;S340&lt;/a&gt; and pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PNY-CS1311-120GB-Internal-Solid/dp/B019H3B3P6/ref=sr_1_16?s=pc&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481492729&amp;amp;sr=1-16&amp;amp;keywords=120gb+ssd"&gt;PNY CS1311 120GB&lt;/a&gt; SSD along with your HDD. Also, you could possibly get an RX 480 like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/XFX-RX-480P836BM-Radeon-3Displayport-PCI-Express/dp/B01KCWZ0DM/ref=sr_1_7?s=pc&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481492832&amp;amp;sr=1-7&amp;amp;keywords=rx+480&amp;amp;refinements=p_n_feature_four_browse-bin%3A6066318011"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; to save money on non-SLI motherboards and FreeSync monitors instead of a GSync one.

Hamakua	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I wasn&amp;#39;t anal about keeping spoilers away from you I&amp;#39;d easily seal it if you were still on the fence.  Combat is leagues better than 1/2.  Here is the thing, the combat was the &lt;em&gt;weakest element&lt;/em&gt; of The Witcher 3 - and that&amp;#39;s not meant to be a put-down on the combat but an accolade on the writing, storie&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;, plot&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;,  world building and atmosphere.  Amazing music- especially one particular area and you will know what I mean when you get there - haunting meets melancholy and have a child.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A strong suggestion is to play through the main story, then hearts of stone plot, then Blood and Wine -  it&amp;#39;s not mandatory, but knowing what I know I&amp;#39;d do it all again in that order even if I were playing for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s really hard to put into perspective just how much CDPR raised the bar in the industry without having played it, then after you have it sort of ruins the gaming landscape - at least for single player value, fidelity, and experience.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am not a day-1 or pre-order type of person, and I didn&amp;#39;t with W1 or W2 or even W3 (even waited a long time on the DLC) - but W3 has me set in pre-ordering and season-passing Cyberpunk 2077, sight unseen.

Only complaint is that it doesn&amp;#39;t do anything to address the shoulder buttons- they aren&amp;#39;t covered by the grip so they&amp;#39;re still tiny and don&amp;#39;t have enough give for me. But that&amp;#39;s a gripe with Nintendo&amp;#39;s design, not theirs. For that reason though, I&amp;#39;m thinking of switching to a Hori grip. Those have these chunky shoulder button overlays.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2ncb6	2016-12-11 22:06:05	MHXX Hunting Gear grip	t1_db2ncb6	MonsterHunter	t5_2rron	t1_db29grt

rhomboidus	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your fireplace doesn&amp;#39;t have a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Panacea-15403-Wrought-Grate-24-Inch/dp/B0013K02JA/ref=sr_1_4?s=lawn-garden&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481493298&amp;amp;sr=1-4&amp;amp;keywords=fireplace"&gt;fire grate&lt;/a&gt; in it go get one at the hardware store. They make things much easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The first thing to know is that you need to be using seasoned wood to really get a good fire going. If you live in the boonies and you have a truck you can normally just buy it off people on craigslist or in the classifieds. If not, you can order some and have it delivered. Either way you&amp;#39;ll need to stack it outside someplace dry and off the ground. If you&amp;#39;re only planning a few fires here and there you can just buy wood in packs at most supermarkets or hardware stores.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next, wood arrangement! Fires need oxygen, fuel, and heat. The biggest mistake people make with fireplaces is not allowing for proper airflow. You want to start with pieces about the thickness of your arm. Lay them parallel across your fire grate, leaving several inches of space between them. Then do another layer perpendicular on top of the first. (Use 2-4ish pieces per layer depending on how big your fireplace/grate is) Add some nice dry kindling between the layers (not a lot, handful or two of sticks), cram in some rolled up newspaper, and light. Once your fire gets established you can add a big log or two to the top to keep it going longer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You can also buy some of those Duraflame (or similar brand) starter logs/bricks. It&amp;#39;s cheating, but it makes things quicker and easier since those burn hot and long enough to catch medium-sized pieces of wood without having to fool with kindling.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2nfg3	2016-12-11 22:07:55	ELI5: Best Way(s) to Start a Wood Fireplace (And Keep It Going)	t1_db2nfg3	explainlikeimfive	t5_2sokd	t3_5hsmv0

tvtoo	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re welcome, good luck with it. Some more thoughts also --&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;a - Re. Amazon Music. If Google Play is preventing you from installing Amazon Music, try installing the APK directly &lt;a href="https://apkpure.com/amazon-music/com.amazon.mp3"&gt;from APK Pure&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.apkmirror.com/apk/amazon-mobile-llc/amazon-music/amazon-music-4-4-0-3-release/amazon-music-4-4-0-android-apk-download/"&gt;APK Mirror&lt;/a&gt; or through the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-com-Amazon-Music/dp/B004FRX0MY"&gt;Amazon Appstore&lt;/a&gt; (the last option may require you to first install the general Amazon app on your phone).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;b - Re. mirroring. You mentioned your phone has a &amp;quot;mirrorshare&amp;quot; button/setting. What happens when you push it? Do you see a (empty) list of devices it can mirror to? Or do you get an error or nothing? (Also, is it &lt;a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?s=7e5382bacef4ca92232fd5da299c59a6&amp;amp;p=60161601&amp;amp;postcount=6"&gt;labeled as &amp;quot;multi-screen&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; If so, I assume it should &lt;a href="https://img.xda-cdn.com/D_xm_004ihpJXwvJ7Ahvm6-T9Go=/http%3A%2F%2Fimages.tapatalk-cdn.com%2F15%2F04%2F16%2F79e9a09efa61205eb2143e16705ab60a.jpg"&gt;mirror successfully to smart TVs with mirroring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?s=7e5382bacef4ca92232fd5da299c59a6&amp;amp;p=60175939&amp;amp;postcount=8"&gt;to Chromecast&lt;/a&gt; ?)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;c - Do you have any smart TVs that support screen mirroring? Your phone may be able to mirror to them, just to test out your phone&amp;#39;s capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;d - Microsoft&amp;#39;s miracast Wireless Display Adapter &lt;a href="https://www.thurrott.com/hardware/1454/use-microsoft-wireless-display-adapter"&gt;gets a lot of love for easy screen mirroring&lt;/a&gt;. So if you have to choose between Chromecast and Microsoft&amp;#39;s stick, Microsoft&amp;#39;s may be a better fit for you.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2nld5	2016-12-11 22:11:13	What's the best way to stream music from any apps on Android Phone to FireTv ?	t1_db2nld5	fireTV	t5_316vr	t1_db2mcz6

also_HIM	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&amp;#39;m not a fan of forced apologies. They don&amp;#39;t mean anything. Certainly it wouldn&amp;#39;t change your son&amp;#39;s feelings about the situation. There&amp;#39;s no magical epiphany in a forced apology; just additional resentment. You can&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; someone to start feeling bad. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is not to say there aren&amp;#39;t serious things that need addressing here. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I did my best not to engage him but it didn&amp;#39;t work. We ended up fighting&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It takes two to tango. Getting into fights - apparently frequently - is not a healthy dynamic. Nobody acts their best in a fight, and never does a fight resolve a problem in a way that is satisfactory to everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You and he both need better tools to communicate and resolve things before they devolve to that point. There are a number of ways to work toward that. Family therapy is one, if you&amp;#39;re up for it. I&amp;#39;m also a big fan of the collaborative and proactive problem-solving process described in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Explosive-Child-Understanding-Frustrated-Chronically/dp/0062270451"&gt;The Explosive Child&lt;/a&gt; - it gives both parents and children the tools to consider each other&amp;#39;s concerns and solve problems in a satisfactory, healthy, and effective way. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2nme7	2016-12-11 22:11:49	Apologizing	t1_db2nme7	Parenting	t5_2qhn3	t3_5hsfzg

FrontpageWatch	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever idea or task you have, write it down somewhere. Once you have written everything down, your mind becomes decluttered and free from distractions. Since you know that your thoughts are safely stored somewhere, it removes the incessant feeling of “I need to remember… something” in your brain. This makes you completely focus on the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit: Holy shit, blew up&lt;br/&gt;\nEdit 2: If you want a more detailed strategy than just simply &amp;quot;writing it down&amp;quot;, be sure to read this this book by David Allen: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nEdit 3: Some people do not seem to understand this post. I mean write down all your &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; ideas and tasks, not things like &amp;quot;I really hate getting stuff stuck in my teeth&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;I should always put hot sauce on my pizza&amp;quot;. Sigh.&lt;br/&gt;\nEdit 4: Google Keep is a fantastic app for this.&lt;br/&gt;\nEdit 5: &lt;a href="https://blog.altova.com/wp-content/uploads/GTD.png"&gt;This workflow diagram has made my life so much easier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nEdit 6: To quote one of the comments which explains my post pretty well:  &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I get very scatter brained and frustrated the more tasks I keep saying I need to get to. Usually a million little small odd jobs that don&amp;#39;t require any real effort to complete but also easy to put off by not being urgent either.\nEventually my mind feels stressed and cluttered and it takes a toll on my ability to think and be productive. Like my mind is expending effort to remember so many little tasks.\nWhen I write EVERYTHING down, and I mean everything, my mind feels a million times lighter because I can forget it all and let go - the thoughts are on paper, not in my head, so I don&amp;#39;t have to remember them. When I feel productive I just grab the list and knock some tasks off. When new things come up I add to the list.\nIt&amp;#39;s one of the VERY few things that GENUINELY helps my mind feel better and less stressed.\nSeriously give it a try if you feel a heavy mind. Hopefully you&amp;#39;ll get as much benefit as I do from it.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2nt4x	2016-12-11 22:15:39	[#989|+9348|386] LPT: Write down all your thoughts.

A little business on the side will help you balance being a dad and supporting your wife in her success. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sounds absolutely ridiculous, but that&amp;#39;s the same crap thrown towards women &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2o4mm	2016-12-11 22:22:14	Communism starts at home	t1_db2o4mm	socialism	t5_2qjii	t1_db2af67

r_sarvas	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks, I&amp;#39;m glad you like it. To answer your questions...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Setup guide - Sorry to say that if there is a setup guide, I didn&amp;#39;t read it. I do IT for a living, so setting up a few devices on a network is not something that I have to think much about.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Paying for themselves - I got into this slowly. It all started from the profits of using CashPirate on a single tablet (not shown). From there, I used the profits to buy another device. The profits from that bought another, and so on. Essentially were paid for from the moment I bought them - except for the first tablet, and that was an Xmas gift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Device management - I don&amp;#39;t use anything to manage my devices, they are placed within easy reach from where I sit by my computer. If the fail when I&amp;#39;m not home or over night, then they fail. If an app starts to fail frequently, then I retask a device to run another app.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The timer - If the timer doesn&amp;#39;t cut off power at the correct time, then it isn&amp;#39;t working. It is a cheap, simple mechanical timer with 1/2 hour settings. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shopping list - Some of the stuff you see in the picture was used because I either had it on hand or bought it cheap. I may not buy some of the same things, if I were to do it again. Still, the two things I do recommend are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D0KI1U"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D0KI1U&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OJ79UK6"&gt;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OJ79UK6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything else - devices included, depends on what is cheap at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2osbi	2016-12-11 22:35:43	Phone to Phone farm-sitting.	t1_db2osbi	beermoney	t5_2s5or	t1_db2ffn4

MysterD77	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think Bethesda, BioWare, Obsidian, and CD Projekt RED all make games that range in the &amp;quot;very good&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;excellent&amp;quot; category.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s face it - all of those companies have their weaknesses. QA seems to always have been a problem for both Bethesda + Obsidian. Bethesda isn&amp;#39;t really good at character + story stuff. BioWare sometimes changes + overhauls their sequels so much, that it can alienate its fan-base (i.e. see Dragon Age 2 + Mass Effect 2).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2ovxf	2016-12-11 22:37:51	[Amazon] [GOG] The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine (DLC) ($9.99/50% off)	t1_db2ovxf	GameDeals	t5_2qwx3	t1_db2hhwc

Love this purchase. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please let me know how does it compare with the fanetec. I was tempted to get their bundle( they where giving a $99 rim free with a $1500 bundle) but I figured I better learn with this first before such upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2pa2g	2016-12-11 22:46:07	[Controller] - Thrustmaster VG T300 Ferrari Alcantara Edition Racing Wheel $299.99 ($479.99 - $180)	t1_db2pa2g	buildapcsales	t5_2s3dh	t1_db2ey0m
still1stben	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know editing can be a big problem. I sat down with an editor a few times and told her what I was trying to do as we went over my book. Basically, we had long discussions about grammar, my use of onomatopoeia, alliteration, and all sorts of other things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was more focused on creating a world and share it with everyone; that I forgot about the most important part. Making the book readable, and i suck at grammar! I admit that. I wanted to recreate the cheap pulp novel/pennydreadful that I had read about in historical text. And although, I didn&amp;#39;t really accomplish that. My editor was able to guide and help with the grammar. I know my story is really good and the characters are realistic, because I was able to discuss these things with my editor. I saved for over a year to be able to afford her. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My point is, I am not saying your story is bad. However, it could be better if you had an editor look it over.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2paj8	2016-12-11 22:46:23	My Authorial Debut 'Ember of Eternity- Aiden's Song' Is Now Available.

LegatoSkyheart	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying a WiiU is still worth it considering the Switch will not have a Disc Slot meaning your Wii and WiiU games are not compatible with a Switch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Further more there&amp;#39;s no guarantee that many games for the Wii or WiiU will ever see a re-release for the Switch. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So games like Bayonetta 2, Hyrule Warriors, Pikmin 3, The Wonderful 101, Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze, or Super Mario 3D World will see a Switch port. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you don&amp;#39;t care for those games, your WiiU can be turned into a Classic Machine easily if you take advantage of the Virtual Console.

Got a couple of followers on twitter. Got a few upset e-mails over the things that happen to some characters, but people like it so far. I am trying to do a free give away soon. So, I will keep you guys updated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hard copy is 10$(US) and kindle 0.99(US).

supertopher	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wired vs Wireless: Wired&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I would not get Bose as a BIFL headphone. Their non-noise cancelling is mediocre at best and the noise cancelling will require a battery (custom). Any headphones that require a custom battery of any sort will wear down over time and eventually not hold a charge. Replacing it will be costly if not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally (again), I don&amp;#39;t like Sennheiser either (I&amp;#39;ve owned multiple pairs including the Momentum Over Ear and HD650 with amps). In my opinion the best BIFL headphones, bar none, no exception, you can disagree, but you are wrong headphones are the &lt;a href="http://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/product-MDR7506/"&gt;Sony MDR-7506&lt;/a&gt;. They are tried and true and have stood the test of time. Just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/review/R1GLP69EPVTB5Y/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;ASIN=B000AJIF4E&amp;amp;channel=detail-glance&amp;amp;nodeID=11091801&amp;amp;store=musical-instruments"&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://kenrockwell.com/audio/sony/mdr-7506.htm"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; of the reviews.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I have owned a number of headphones (from $1500 to $80 and multiple amps) and I keep coming back to these. If you want something a little more modern and portable with a slightly smoother sound I highly recommend the Sony MDR-1R or the Beoplay H6 as very nice comfortable alternatives I think would be worthy of the BIFL title.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2q97y	2016-12-11 23:06:48	I'm interested in investing in headphones, but unsure whether to get wired or wireless.	t1_db2q97y	BuyItForLife	t5_2ss1q	t3_5hgnx9

This book continues to be the number one book I recommend when it comes to starting your journey to learn everything about beer.  It is also &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; book that the Cicerone program wants you read for the first step of their certification process.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As far as beer tasting goes, all I can recommend you do (or keep doing) is to taste as many different beers as possible.  People have their opinions on beers, and choose to drink some rather than others for many different reasons (taste, corporate/independent ownership, political leanings, etc.).  It&amp;#39;s very polarized, and there may be a general consensus about one beer or another, but the only way you can arrive at your own conclusions is to drink those different beers yourself and come to learn what you like.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2qdd5	2016-12-11 23:09:20	Crash course for a beginner	t1_db2qdd5	beer	t5_2qhg1	t3_5hsxv1

jaasx	&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok.  So, then as others have said you need a valve and not a pump.  You could probably easily modify &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Orbit-56862-Single-Dial-Water-Timer/dp/B01HG19L5K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1481497800&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=timed+hose+valve"&gt;something like this&lt;/a&gt;.  It has a valve (solenoid driven?).  I assume you could just override it&amp;#39;s timer with your raspberry pi.  Or, if you really want to use the pump you could hook  up the city water to a tank with a float valve to keep it full.  Then turn the pump on/off to actually do the irrigation.  Diaphragm pumps can run dry fairly well, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend it for long periods so you would want everything set up so at not drain the tank.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;	db2qlzr	2016-12-11 23:14:24	Will a garden hose damage a diaphragm pump?	t1_db2qlzr	AskEngineers	t5_2sebk	t1_db2kuxg
